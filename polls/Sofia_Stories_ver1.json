      "Gizmo Gwen": " Amber is preparing a berry banquet for everyone from Royal Prep and she wants everything perfect. Sofia has picked some blueberries for her and takes them to the kitchen where she meets Gwen, a kitchen maid who likes to invent. However, her father, Chef Andre, doesn't like it when she makes gizmos because he too once tried to invent something, an automatic berry pudding serving machine, but it ended in a humiliating disaster. Gwen takes Sofia to her secret workshop and shows her all her gizmos, an Automatic Sponge, a Built in Baker Cupcake Maker that automatically creates cupcakes, a Teeter Totter Rug Swatter that can beat the dust out of rugs and a Bicycle Built for Tunes which plays music while peddling. Sofia really likes her gizmos, and Gwen always dreams of being an inventor, but because of her father's worries, she feels she will always be a kitchen maid. Meanwhile, back at the great hall, disaster strikes when the castle servants drop the giant jewelled strawberry they were trying to hang up. Sofia and Gwen hear the crash and decide to see what has happened, little did they know they left Gwen's Teeter Totter Rug Swatter running loose. They arrive at the hall and find the giant strawberry cracked and ruined, including Amber's berry bowls. Seeing there will be no time to paint some new ones, Sofia has an idea and asks Gwen if she can invent a gizmo that can paint new berry bowls much faster. At first, Gwen isn't too sure, but she is willing to try. She draws up a plan and has Sofia and her animal friends find all the parts she needs to build her new machine for Amber. In no time, she finishes it and after a successful test Gwen and Sofia take it to the great hall, unaware that a screw has fallen off. Amber brings over the blank bowls for painting but as they get started, Gwen's gizmo suddenly goes haywire, throwing bowls everywhere, trashing Amber's perfect banquet. Gwen's father takes her back to the kitchen and tells her this disaster is why he didn't like her gizmos, which she finally agrees to. She puts her pencil away, and returns to her job of being a kitchen maid. Meanwhile Clover, Robin, Mia and Whatnaught spot Gwen's Teeter Totter Rug Swatter still running loose in the hallways and try to catch it. It heads back to the kitchen where Whatnaught finds a missing screw that fell off Gwen's machine which was why it went wrong. After showing Sofia, she tries to convince Gwen to fix her machine but she has decided to give up on her dream of becoming an inventor. However Sofia tells her if she gives up on her dreams they will never come true. All she has to do is to believe in them. With that encouragement, Gwen goes off to fix her gizmo and this time it works perfectly. Everyone is very impressed and so is Gwen's father, for the first time ever he is proud of her. With the use of Gwen's other gizmos, as well as her father's pudding-serving invention, now fixed with a screw, Amber's berry banquet is back on track and King Roland makes Gwen a full time inventor."

      "Princess Jade": " At Royal Prep, it is School Swap Day, the day where one of Royal Prep's students swaps places with a student from Dunwiddie School, Sofia's old school, so the Royal student can learn about village life and the villager can learn about Royal life. Sofia is excited about the swap since this means she will see one of her village friends. Sure enough, the Dunwiddie School student attending the school for the day is Jade. Sofia and Jade are happy to see each other since they will be going to school together for the first time since she went to the castle. Flora asks Sofia to show Jade around and the two of them agree with their hand clap. Flora then explains the Swap Day itinerary: Jade will take classes with the other students, then they will go to Dunwiddie School for lunch, and later come back to Royal Prep for a Royal Ball where the Swap students make a presentation about all they have learned. Jade asks Sofia for a tour and she obliges. During the tour, Sofia and Jade find a painting in the Hall of Royals of Fredericka Assemblia, who looks a lot like Jade. They wonder if Jade is related to her. Jade points out she has a great-great aunt named Fredericka. Hearing that, Sofia and Jade are overjoyed since they think it means Jade is a princess and therefore she can come to Royal Prep everyday and decide to tell everybody at lunch. On the way to class, they also wonder which Royal was sent to Dunwiddie School. At Dunwiddie School, Ms. Candoo, Sofia's old teacher, introduces the Swap student from Royal Prep: Princess Amber. Amber sits next to Ruby, who is going to be her guide, confident that she will excel in class. However, when she sees how different the classes at Dunwiddie School are from Royal Prep she quickly becomes miserable. Back at Royal Prep, Sofia and Jade are having fun in Sorcery Class, Flying Derby, and Enchanted Art Class, where Sofia puts Jade in a fancy gown and pair of shoes. At lunch, Ruby tells Sofia and Jade that Amber watched them learn about rocks, history, and glass blowing and is not even trying anything they do due to not liking School Swap Day. Sofia and Jade tell Ruby that Jade might be a princess. After Sofia leaves to say hello to Miss Candoo, Ruby tells Jade she and her friends at Dunwiddie School will miss her. Hearing this, Jade realizes she will miss them too and starts to have second thoughts about going to Royal Prep. After the singing of the two school's anthems, Jade tells Ruby she does not want to go to Royal Prep as she will miss her and their friends, but is afraid to tell Sofia because it might hurt her feelings. Ruby is certain that Sofia will understand and Jade decides to tell her. However, she ultimately does not have the heart to, especially after Sofia has decided to make the announcement at the Royal Ball instead. After lunch, Miss Candoo has the class do Architecture. Amber confides her fears of getting things wrong to Ruby. Ruby encourages Amber and she finally starts to enjoy School Swap Day to the point where she does not even get upset when she rips her gown. Back at Royal Prep, it is time for the presentations and Jade resolves to try to tell Sofia the truth again. However, she once again does not have the heart to do it, especially after Sofia gives her her own tiara. Sofia makes the announcement about a new Princess attending Royal Prep, but when she pulls back the curtain, she finds Jade gone. Thinking quickly, Sofia calls an unsuspecting Amber to the stage for her sister to make her presentation to stall the audience while she leaves to find Jade. Amber presents her lodestones that lift heavier objects the larger the stone is, but accidentally gets her belt magnetized to the biggest stone and starts spinning, which gets her dizzy. Sofia finds Jade skipping magic stones down the river. After enough urging, Jade finally tells Sofia how she feels and apologizes for hurting her feelings. Sofia is somewhat disappointed, but is happy that Jade told her how she felt and apologizes to Jade for making her feel that she couldn't tell her the truth. Jade panics because the others kids will see the painting of Fredericka and find out she’s the new princess. They go back to the presentation to prevent it, pretending it was just a mistake. However Amber tries to stop herself from spinning by grabbing the curtains, but instead pulls it back and reveals the painting of Fredericka Assemblia, revealing that Jade is the new Princess. Jade tells everybody she has no desire go to Royal Prep and asks if she can stay at Dunwiddie School. Flora and Miss Candoo tell her there is no need to worry, as Fredericka Assemblia was not even a princess; she was actually the architect who built Royal Prep. Her portrait was hung in the Hall of Royals just to honor her. Amber still feels a bit dizzy so Hildegard and Clio take her to get her dressed into a Royal Gown. Jade and Sofia are overjoyed to hear that Jade is not a princess so she can stay at Dunwiddie. Sofia tells Jade, no matter what school she goes to, she will always be her friend."

      "The Royal Dragon": " At Zumaria Castle, Sofia is saying good-bye to Vivian when she notices Crackle drop something. The something is revealed to be an invitation to the annual Dragon Roast n Toast, a party for every dragon from every kingdom. Crackle feels like she cannot go since all attendees are supposed to bring their best dragon buddy along and she does not have any dragon buddies at all. Hearing this, Sofia tells Crackle she will go with her. Crackle reminds her that the Roast N Toast is for dragons only, to which Sofia uses her Amulet to turn herself into a dragon. Crackle is delighted by this, since it means that she and Sofia can go to the Roast N Toast. The next day, Crackle and Sofia are on their way to the Roast N Toast in the Kingdom of Brazendell and are practicing their moves on the way. Crackle tries to do the Quadruple Loop de Spin but messes it up in a way that makes her crash. When they arrive at the Roast N Toast, Sofia recognizes her dragon friends from Enchancia and Brazendell such as Willawing and Flambeau to which Crackle reminds her she cannot reveal who she is. Crackle's attempts to make friends are wrecked by a dragon named Sizzle. Crackle explains that Sizzle is her childhood rival due to the fact that she was always the star of every show, had the widest wingspan, knew all the best fire tricks, and had the most friends. Sizzle comes over and quickly shows herself to be a show-off. Suddenly, The Duchess, the leader of all dragons, calls everyone over for the Roast N Toast. Nearby, Sir Oliver and his horse Basil are planning to ruin the Roast N Toast as revenge for his banishment. At the Roast N Toast, Sizzle is bragging about how she is buddies with The Duchess and how she is teaching her Head Dragon skills like how to make a tornado with her wings so she can become the leader of the dragons. Jealous, Crackle tells Sizzle that Sofia is even more important than The Duchess. When Sizzle expresses skepticism, Crackle lies by saying that Sofia is the Royal Dragon of Enchancia and has ten castles including one made of gold and diamonds, to the joy of the other dragons. Meanwhile, Sir Oliver attempts to ruin the Roast N Toast by dousing the bonfire with water balloons. This fails because the trigger on his bow is stuck and his water balloons shoot in the air and land on him. Back at the Roast N Toast, the other Dragons are fawning over an oblivious Sofia, who almost gives herself away by greeting Flembeau, Nitewing, and Smokely. The Duchess announces that it is time for some singing and asks who would like to sing first. Crackle happily volunteers, only for Sizzle to protest that she always sings the first song. Sofia says Crackle should get a turn which Crackle agrees with by telling them she was the star of the Leafsong Festival. When Sizzle says she has been in lots of shows too, Crackle lies again by saying she sang for King Roland and Queen Miranda who gave her a big trophy because of how much they loved her singing. Sofia takes Crackle aside and asks her why she said that since it's not true. Crackle expresses how fed up she is with Sizzle getting all the attention and thinks she can make friends by telling tall tales. Sofia tells her she needs to try just being herself, but Crackle ignores her and engages in a singing battle with Sizzle who later wins. Nearby, Sir Oliver tries to ruin the Roast N Toast by setting ants on the dragons. This fails when the ants go after the sugar cubes on his person instead. Back at the Roast N Toast it is time for the big Aerial Show. Crackle decides to make friends by showing she is a better flier then Sizzle. Sofia tells her she should just be herself but Crackle likes her plan better. During the flight, Sofia discovers the other dragons think she is the Royal Dragon of Enchancia and tells Crackle about it. Realizing she had something to do with this, Sofia asks Crackle if this is why the other dragons have been fawning over her which she confirms. Crackle asks Sofia to pretend to be what she said she is so she can make friends but Sofia refuses. Desperate, Crackle attempts the Quadruple Loop de Spin and, like before, she messes it up in a way that make her crash into Sofia. The crash makes Sofia's Amulet come off her and she turns back to normal. The Duchess catches Sofia, who puts her Amulet back on. Flambeau, Smokley, and Nitelite are shocked to see Sofia and ask her why Crackle told them she was the Royal Dragon of Enchancia to which Sizzle reveals that Crackle was lying the whole time. Crackle admits she lied about everything because she does not have any dragon friends and sadly flies away. Crackle comes across Sir Oliver and Basil in the woods and hears him planning to ruin the Roast N Toast by trapping the dragons in a net and goes back to warn the others. Unfortunately because of her lies, the other dragons do not believe her. Sofia appears and Crackle tells her about the knight. Sofia identifies him as Sir Oliver but is too late to stop him from trapping the dragons. Crackle urges Sizzle to save their friends to which Sizzle admits she also lied about everything because she didn't have a dragon buddy either and she and Crackle reconcile. Working together, Sofia, Crackle, and Sizzle free the other dragons and drive Sir Oliver away. The Roast N Toast resumes with a marshmallow roast with Sofia joining in after she turns herself back into a dragon."

      "The Lost Pyramid": " At Royal Prep, the Princess Adventure Club is having a meeting. Princess Zooey announces that at next week's meeting they will present the Scroll of Discovery, which will note all the amazing discoveries they have made and will be placed in the trophy case for all to see. Sofia's addition to the scroll will be her discovery of an ancient idol in a temple in Tangu, Clio's addition will be her discovery of a new species of Rainbow Moth, and Amber's addition will be her discovery of Amberina Major. Princess Hildegard does not voice what her addition will be and claims it is because she has too many to pick. As Zooey leads everyone to where they will discuss their next adventure, Sofia notices that Hildy is upset. She admits that the real reason she did not voice her addition is because she has not made any discoveries. Sofia says she could make a discovery during their next adventure, and they go off to find the rest of the club. In the Club's Adventure room, Zooey announces the Club's next adventure: Exploring the Lost Pyramids of Khaldune. Amber is confused as to how they will explore the Pyramids if they're supposed to be lost. Zooey explains that they were lost for centuries: An evil wizard named Hizzan built them centuries ago to hide his stolen treasures. They were discovered by the famous archaemagicalogist Princess Cassandra: a person who studies ancient magical objects. According to Zooey, there were five Lost Pyramids and Hizzan arranged them into a pattern. Hildegard believes that they cannot find the fifth Lost Pyramid and that they should pick a different adventure. When Hildegard puts her hand on a map with the Lost Pyramids on it, Sofia deduces and reveals Hizzan's pattern: In the shape of a hand. Using a diagram Sofia drew around Hildegard's hand, the Princess Adventure Club is able to figure out where the fifth Pyramid is. As they head to the hydrofoil, Hildegard gloats about her discovery, to which Amber and Clio look at her in disbelief. Zooey reminds Hildegard that it was Sofia who discovered the pattern, to which Sofia states that it was because of Hildegard. Hildegard thanks Sofia for giving her the credit, to which Sofia tells her it was a team effort. Disappointed, Hildegard vows to discover something big all by herself on their adventure. Later, the Princess Adventure Club is on route to the Kingdom of Khaldune in Zooey's hydrofoil. Along the way, they receive a surprise visit by Princess Cassandra, who flies in on a gryffin. Zooey explains that she is going to be their guide. When Cassandra asks who discovered where the fifth Lost Pyramid is, Hildegard is about to say it was her, only for Sofia to step in and say it was a team effort. Cassandra tells the Club that every archaemagicalogist needs help and introduces the Club to her Guide Lemur, Sally. This makes Zooey deduce and reveal that Cassandra is blind. The group arrives in the Kingdom of Khaldune. Cassandra leads the group down and asks them what they see. Hildegard tells her she cannot see anything other than miles of desert. She starts to think Sofia got it wrong, but Cassandra is convinced that she got it right as Hizzan was tricky. Hearing this, Hildegard vows to find the final Lost Pyramid. However sometime later, they still have not found it. Cassandra tells the club that sometimes the answer in front of them cannot be seen. Hearing this, Zooey decides to use the hydrofoil's cannon to blow the sand away. Afterwards, Hildegard spots a rock with a picture of a sphinx on it. The picture is revealed to be a switch and when Hildegard presses it the fifth Lost Pyramid rises out of the desert. Hildegard declares that she found the final Lost Pyramid, to which Clio reminds her that it was because of Zooey's idea much to Hildy's chagrin. Cassandra leads the group inside. Inside, it is completely dark. When Hildegard asks Cassandra how they are going to see where they are going, she tells her that the Lost Pyramids all have Forever Torches on the walls. Sofia finds one, and after being told to do so by Cassandra, pulls it down, lighting the place up. They come to a wall with pictures that Cassandra notes are hieroglyphics. Zooey explains that a long time ago people used to write in pictures instead of words. Sofia asks Cassandra if they should tell her what they look like, but she says there is no need. She can feel what the hieroglyphic carved in the stone are, which is how she fell in love with archeomagicology. Using this ability, Cassandra reads the hieroglyphics and reveals that this Lost Pyramid has the greatest treasure Hizzan stole: The Oasis Stone. Cassandra explains that years ago Khaldune used to be lush and green thanks to the Oasis Stone. After Hizzan stole it and put it in the temple, he built all kinds of booby traps. Cassandra and Zooey want to find the Oasis Stone to bring life back to the desert Khaldune has become ever since it was stolen. Cassandra opens the wall and leads them in. They quickly arrive at the first trap: A pit they cannot see the way across. Cassandra tells them to close their eyes and asks them what they smell. Amber smells Hildegard's perfume, Fleur de Freezenburg. Sofia however smells moss. Cassandra sends Sally to find the moss, which they use to get across. Cassandra compliments them as they are beginning to rely on their other senses to get them through. After a watery ride, Cassandra leaves the others behind to scout ahead. Hoping to get the Stone first, Hildegard goes after her. While they search the next room, Hildegard finds a switch with a jaguar on it, which, thanks to Cassandra's translation earlier, she knows leads to the Oasis Stone. After Cassandra leaves, she presses it and goes into a secret passageway. When Cassandra gets back with the others, Sofia uses her sense of smell to find out what Hildegard did and goes after her. She finds her just as she is about to grab the Oasis Stone. A Sphinx awakens and demands to know how she discovered the way in. Hildegard lies by saying she discovered everything all by herself. This proves to be a mistake as this makes the sphinx decide to trap her. The others show up and help Sofia rescue Hildegard, who grabs the Oasis Stone. They head back outside. Back outside, the group finds King Nasir and his staff waiting for them. When King Nasir realized the fifth Lost Pyramid had been found he came to see who found it. Hildegard reveals that she recovered the Oasis Stone. At King Nasir's request, the group takes it to the top of the Pyramid. The Stone's magic turns the desert back into the valley it once was. King Nasir says that Hildegard has made the greatest discovery in all of Khaldune, but Hildegard says she made a greater discovery - that she has wonderful friends, crediting them all for helping in finding the stone."

      "The Floating Palace": " Traveling across the sea aboard a ship known as The Floating Palace, Sofia is in the library reading a book when the Royal Family arrives at a cove known as Merroway Cove for a vacation. When Sofia asks if they'll meet any mermaids, Roland and Admiral Hornpipe both tell her mermaids are not real. Also accompanying the royal family is Cedric, who is out on another scheme to take over Enchancia -- only this time, he's not after the Amulet of Avalor. Instead, he’s in search of an enchanted comb known as the Mermaid Comb of Merroway Cove, that gives whoever possesses it the power to harness the ocean. He takes a boat to a cave and transforms himself into a sea monster and Wormwood into a squid. Meanwhile, Sofia meets up with Clover and heads down to the swimming platform. Once there, they spot a mermaid who gets trapped in a net. Sofia pulls her onto the platform and helps her get untangled. Once free, Sofia introduces herself to the mermaid who introduces herself as Oona and the two girls become fast friends. Oona is amazed by the Floating Palace which was why she came up to get a closer look. She notices Sofia's amulet glowing and when she asks her about it, Sofia tells Oona it’s enchanted. Oona tells her that the comb she's wearing is enchanted as well, but doesn't know what its powers are because her mother refuses to tell her stating that she’s not old enough yet. After she gets back in the water, Oona discovers her fin was injured by the net. Sofia takes off her shoes so she can get in the water and help her. The moment her feet makes contact with the water, she transforms into a mermaid. Remembering the glow her new friend saw earlier and the amulet's rule, Sofia tells Oona her amulet gives her special powers when she does good deeds. Since she helped her when she was in trouble, her amulet blessed her with the ability to transform into a mermaid. All this makes Sofia squeal with joy as she happily hops into the water. She drifts down a few fathoms until she opens her eyes and squeals \"This is incredible!\" and starts swimming at lightning speed before returning to the surface. With the use of her new abilities, Sofia helps Oona swim home. Meanwhile, Clover meets a seagull named Farley who tries to make off with a bag of blueberries that Clover marked as his lunch. A battle erupts between them that causes the blueberries to get spilled overboard and gets them both stuck in a lifesaver. Meanwhile, Sofia takes Oona to the bottom of the cove and all the sights make Sofia squeal with delight. The two girls enter a shipwreck that Oona uses as her hideaway. Suddenly, a seahorse appears and calls out for Oona who tries to hide Sofia. She tells Sofia that seahorse is her friend Sven who gets very suspicious around strangers. Sven finds the two girls and then asks Oona about where she’s been and who her new friend is, stating he hasn't seen her in the cove before. Oona says Sofia is visiting from another colony and when she hurt her fin she helped her get back. When he hears this, Sven panics and says Oona needs to see the doctor right away just as an older mermaid shows up. After being told about Oona's hurt fin, the mermaid proceeds to examine her fin: It turns out her injury is so minor it can be treated with some moon kelp. Oona introduces Sofia to the mermaid who happens to be her big sister Cora, who was sent by their mother to check on her. After Cora bandages her fin and leaves, Oona begins to moan about how her sister treats her like a merbaby, which Sofia understands completely as she knows how it feels. Then, Sofia asks where the other merfolk live and Oona and Sven give her a tour of the cove. Unbeknownst to Sofia, she and Oona are being watched by Sea Monster Cedric and Wormwood the Squid who recognize Oona's comb as the item they seek. When he spots Sofia, he is shocked because he knows she will ruin his chances of getting the comb. Suddenly, the Floating Palace appears from above and Cora shows up to tell Oona their mother wants them back at the castle. Sofia follows the two mermaids to the coral castle where she meets their mother, Queen Emmaline of Merroway Cove and her chief advisor, Plank. It turns out that the merfolk think humans are dangerous because many years ago, a ship entered the cove and tried to capture one of the colony's inhabitants and most of its people were hurt. Plank proposes that Queen Emmaline move the ship from the cove by conjuring a storm with her Trident. Cora is the only one who supports this decision but Sven and Queen Emmaline view the plan as too reckless and irresponsible because it might sink the ship. Knowing her family is on that ship, Sofia is immediately against this plan and insists on a peaceful alternative. She tells Plank and Queen Emmaline that she will go up and persuade them to move the ship. When Queen Emmaline and Plank both ask her how she would do that since they think she's a mermaid, Sofia reveals she's actually a human and the ship belongs to her family to the shock of the entire mercolony except for Oona, who knew the whole time. When Plank and Cora start acting negatively towards Sofia, both Oona and Sven swim forward and defend her by telling everyone how Sofia helped Oona when she was hurt. Sofia gives the Mermaid Queen her word that she will get the ship to leave and sadly bids Oona farewell before leaving. Oona goes after Sofia and apologizes for how everyone acted. Sofia tells Oona the only thing she's upset about is that she'll never see her again and gives her a loving hug before sadly continuing to head back to the ship. Just then, trouble erupts for both girls. As Oona starts to head back home, Sea Monster Cedric appears and attacks her. Sofia hears Oona calling for help and dives back into the ocean to help her. Oona heads into the kelp forest but gets ambushed by Wormwood the Squid and Cedric captures her. Sofia finally arrives in the kelp forest and calls out for Oona but to no avail. Realizing the monster must've kidnapped Oona, Sofia heads back to tell Queen Emmaline what happened. Unfortunately, Plank doesn't believe her and accuses her family of kidnapping Oona and urges Queen Emmaline to use her trident to conjure a massive storm that will sink the Floating Palace. Convinced that Plank is right, Queen Emmaline gives Sofia until sundown to return her daughter or she'll use her trident to do as Plank suggested. Sven goes after Sofia because he could tell she was telling the truth the whole time. On the ship, it turns out the royal family hasn't even noticed that Sofia is gone and are only just now noticing but they all assume that she's in her room finishing her book. When Sofia gets back on board, she heads to her family and tells them about Oona's kidnapping and her mother's threat to sink the Floating Palace. Unfortunately they don't believe her and with no one else to turn to Sofia now believes its up to her and her animal friends to find and rescue Oona before it's too late. She frees Clover and Farley from the lifesaver and instructs the seagull to take to the skies and look for Oona. He finds her locked in a cage on the monster's boat and goes back to tell Sofia, Sven, and Clover. The four of them find the cave and find out the monster knows magic and wants Oona's comb. Sofia tries to rescue her but the sea monster is too powerful for her and she fails. Meanwhile, Queen Emmaline gets tired of waiting for Oona to come back and uses her trident to conjure a storm to sink the Floating Palace. Sofia notices the storm in the distance and finally feels like all hope is lost: She failed to rescue Oona and knows the second the monster gets her comb there will be no telling what he'll do to her mermaid friend and her family will be drowned for a crime they never committed. Sven suggests going back to tell Emmaline they found Oona but Sofia refuses stating that she won't believe her. Suddenly, Sofia's amulet begins to glow summoning Princess Ariel. She tells Sofia she still has a chance to save Oona by enlisting Cora to help by showing her that she cares about Oona as much as Cora does. Soon after Ariel vanishes, Sofia manages to convince Cora to help her and the two Princesses head off to the rescue while Sven and his family go to stop Queen Emmaline. Meanwhile, Queen Emmaline is about to turn the storm into a typhoon when Sven and his family intervene. With the trident in their possession, they lead Emmaline and Plank to where Oona is being held. With Sofia and Cora working together, they successfully rescue Oona and defeat the sea monster with the power of Oona's comb. The two mermaids are reunited with their mother who apologizes to Sofia for her rashness and, using the trident, stops the storm. While she does this, she is seen by Sofia's family and Admiral Hornpipe forcing them to realize that Sofia was right all along. Sofia heads back to the ship and happily reunites with her family who all apologize for not believing her. Then she takes them to meet the merfolk who all become good friends with them and Sofia and Oona are allowed to remain friends forever. Meanwhile, a defeated Cedric returns to the Floating Palace and turns himself and Wormwood back to normal."

      "Princesses to the Rescue!": " King Roland, Princess Sofia, Princess Amber, and Prince James are visiting the Kingdom of Wei-Ling. While Princess Jun is giving Amber and Sofia a tour of the sculpture garden, James and Jin find a treasure map inside the statue of a jaguar and run off to go find it. Soon after they leave, the princesses tell their fathers where they've gone. Emperor Quon is disturbed by this because the Treasure of the Jade Jaguar is guarded by a real jaguar. He tells Roland and the girls that many years ago the Jade Jaguar ravaged all of Wei-Ling stealing the people's treasure but he dispatched the royal sorcerer, Wu-Chang, to deal with him. Using his magic to give himself the ability to talk to animals, Wu-Chang offered 10,000 pieces of gold if he stayed in his cave which the jaguar agreed to and his kingdom has been safe ever since. Quon also tells them that the Jaguar is so protective of his treasure that there's no telling what he'll do to the boys if they go into his cave which is why they must go after them immediately. Sofia wants to come along and help but Roland and Quon both tell her it's too dangerous and to wait at the palace for them to come back. After they leave, a frustrated Sofia tells Jun and Amber she wishes their fathers would let her help. Jun tells Sofia their fathers can handle this but Sofia is unconvinced. James and Jin soon find the treasure cave which is full of gold and diamonds and encounter the Jade Jaguar, which chases and traps them. Meanwhile back at the palace, Sofia, Amber and Jun are being entertained by Wu-Chang. When Jun notices that Sofia isn't paying attention to the entertainment and hasn't touched her food, she asks her friend what's bothering her. Sofia tells her that she's too worried about what the Jade Jaguar will do to the boys to enjoy herself. When he hears where Roland, Quon and the boys went, Wu-Chang panics and tells the girls about a trap the Jade Jaguar had set to stop anyone from stealing his treasure. Knowing their fathers will also be in danger, Sofia insists they go after them before it’s too late. Before the three princesses set off to the rescue, Wu-Chang shows them a shortcut and tells them about a secret passage that will help them avoid the trap set up by the Jade Jaguar. Roland and Quon are still in the jungle looking for James and Jin and soon find their way to the treasure cave. They manage to find their sons but end up getting caught in the trap themselves. Sofia, Amber and Jun arrive just in time to hear their fathers and brothers calling for help. Instead of going through the main entrance, Sofia advises they find the secret way in by going around the cave. They soon find themselves further in the jungle and come across a maze of warrior statues. The princesses try to get pass them but the statues won’t let them. They try and try again but soon they quickly give up. Just as Amber and Jun are leaving, Sofia’s amulet glows and a mysterious warrior suddenly jumps out in front of her. Sofia doesn't recognize the warrior until she removes her helmet and reveals herself to be Mulan, who has been summoned by Sofia's amulet. Mulan reminds Amber and Jun that she never gave up so easily when she took her father's place in the army to save China from invading Huns. She tells the Princesses that if they believe they're stronger than they know, they can pass anything on their way to rescue their fathers and brothers. With Mulan's encouragement, they find a way to get pass the Maze of Warriors by swinging across on vines. After passing the Maze of Warriors, Mulan leaves the three Princesses to continue on their rescue mission. They encounter giant silver moths that Amber fans away with her fan, a lagoon swimming with giant lizards that help them across after Jun soothes them with her flute-playing and soon find the secret entrance to the treasure cave behind a waterfall. They find their families and the Jade Jaguar. Sofia tricks him into chasing her and gets him stuck in the way they came in. Sofia is able to make a deal with the Jade Jaguar promising to leave his treasure alone if he lets her family and friends go. After getting the Jade Jaguar unstuck, Sofia, Amber and Jun get Roland, Quon, James and Jin out of the trap and everyone leaves the cave. They return to the palace and celebrate the success of the daring rescue made by the three young Princesses."

      "Her Royal Spyness": " It's night at Enchancia Castle. Amber is stargazing while Sofia is reading a book about mysterious creatures by Professor Zacharias Fleeber. Sofia shows Amber the chapter on sealians, people who are part human and part seal. Amber returns to her telescope and gets into the peeping tom habit when she and Sofia are told it is dinner time. At dinner, Sofia tells James and her mother about what she has read. Miranda tells her kids that since their father is in Tangu for the Tri-Kingdom Summit it is the perfect time to discuss Roland's birthday. James states that he already has his gift for his father and asks if he can be excused. When Miranda asks her son if he ate his vegetables James tells his mother he did and leaves. When Amber and Sofia return to Amber's room, Amber looks through her telescope and sees James dumping vegetables on the ground and assumes that James lied when he said he ate his vegetables and that he is throwing them away. Amber goes out to catch him red-handed and get her brother in trouble despite Sofia's protests that it might not be what it looks like. Amber runs up to James and goes \"Aha!\" Miranda appears and asks what is going on. Amber tells her mother her assumption only for an angry James to reveal that the vegetables he dumped out are extras Chef Andre gave him from the kitchen that he brought out for some hungry bunnies he found. Sofia scolds Amber for her conclusion jumping while James is angry that Amber was spying on him. Miranda tells her oldest child that she and her father got her that telescope to look at stars, not to spy on people and that when you spy on something from far away you might not see what is really going on. The next morning, Sofia goes into her sister's room and sees her spying again. Amber claims to have seen a sealian and shows Sofia, who also assumes it is a sealian. They then hear a blaring sound that they assume is the sealian song, a magical song sealians use to bring people to the Stormy Triangle, a stormy part of the seventeen seas that is really hard to sail through. They then see a figure they recognize as their mother and believe that she is in danger. Amber wants to go tell their father but Sofia reminds her that Roland is in Tangu so Amber decides that she and Sofia have to save Miranda themselves. After changing into their Flying Horsemanship outfits, they go to the stables and then take off on Saffron and Minimus into the Stormy Triangle. They arrive on an island where they meet Professor Fleeber, who admits all he wrote about the sealians are based on stories that he heard about them from sailors who have sailed through the Stormy Triangle and he is here to get first hand knowledge about sealians. Sofia proposes that they join forces and together they set off. Out to sea, the trio see some sealians in the distance to the professor's joy. They follow them in the hopes of saving Miranda. Suddenly, a storm comes up and blows Sofia, Amber, and their mounts into a ship where they find their mother. Miranda asks her daughters what they are doing out here and Sofia and Amber tell her their assumption only to be told by their mother that she is taking sailing lessons from the \"sealian\", who is revealed to be Captain Macintosh. Miranda wants to take Roland sailing as a birthday gift and reiterates what she said the day before: When you spy on things from afar, they can look different from what they really are. Amber promises that she will never spy again and Sofia promises that she will never let her imagination run wild again. The ship is stuck in the storm. The sealians from earlier appear and, after explaining that their song is to help them get home, help guide the ship through the storm. They then meet the sealians' family. Sofia asks if she can take one of the sealians' cocohorns home as a gift for her father and they say yes. Miranda and her daughters head home with Minimus and Saffron demanding a fun day for all this. At Roland's birthday party, Sofia gives her gift and James plays the bagpipes for him. Sofia and Amber notes how James's music sounds like what they thought was the sealians' song with Amber noting \"Boy, were we wrong.\""

      "Beauty is the Beast": " Sofia and Clover are playing Bewitching Bowling in the garden when suddenly Sofia's Amulet starts to glow. Clover thinks a Princess must be coming but instead of a Princess appearing Sofia disappears. Sofia reappears in the gardens near a castle somewhere and wonders aloud where she is. Suddenly, she hears a woman crying. The woman hides behind some bushes. Sofia finds the woman wearing a hooded cloak and introduces herself. She learns that the woman is Princess Charlotte and that she is in the Kingdom of Isleworth. After Sofia promises not to scream, Charlotte reveals that she has been turned into a beast. Suddenly, they hear people coming and go hide. While hiding, Charlotte sees Sofia's Amulet and states she used to have one just like it. Sofia realizes she used to wear the Amulet and, after remembering the glow she and Clover saw earlier, tells Charlotte what Cinderella told her after her first summoning, and that the Amulet brought her to Isleworth to help her return to normal. She also deduces that Charlotte has been cursed for doing something bad. Suddenly, Zinessa, the most famous enchantress in the Kingdom of Isleworth, appears to tell the pair that she cursed Charlotte as punishment for rejecting her goblin friend's request to be invited to her Royal Ball. Charlotte replies she did it just because he was a goblin to which Zinessa states that she hurt his feelings. Even Sofia admits that is a little bad. Charlotte demands that she be returned to normal but Zinessa tells her she cannot to which Sofia deduces must be because Charlotte has to break the curse herself. Zinessa tells Charlotte that to break the curse she has to become true friends with the goblin and tells Charlotte and Sofia where to find him. The pair set out to find the goblin. Meanwhile back at the castle, Charlotte's mother Queen Everly becomes concerned about her and her father King Philip sends the guards to check on her. Sofia and Charlotte arrive at the goblin's house. Charlotte is afraid to make an attempt stating that Goblins are beasts. When the goblin comes out, he sees Charlotte and runs back in scared. Charlotte feels terrible that the goblin shut the door in her face out of fear to which Sofia explains is probably how he felt when she refused to invite him to her party. Believing this makes them even, Charlotte hopes this will be enough to break the curse but Sofia tells her breaking a curse is never that easy. Charlotte cannot see how she will become friends with him if he is afraid of her. Because the goblin wanted to come to the Royal Ball, Sofia deduces that the goblin must like parties and tells Charlotte to throw him a Royal Party. Sofia goes inside and learns that the Goblin loves Royal Things and invites him to the party. She also helps the goblin see that Charlotte just wants to be friends. They then proceed to have their tea party. Meanwhile, the Royal Guards have discovered that Charlotte's gone and assume a goblin took her. Back at the tea party, the trio are having fun and Charlotte and the goblin, who's name is Morris, quickly discover they have a lot in common as they show each other's talents; Morris demonstrates his throwing skills and Charlotte dances the waltz with him. When Charlotte's tiara falls off her head and into some mud, Morris goes to clean it and Sofia goes to get more berries. Suddenly, the Guards arrive and Charlotte hides. When Morris comes out and they see Charlotte's tiara in his hand, the Guards arrest him and take him back to the castle. When Sofia gets back, Charlotte tells her what happened and they head back to Isleworth Castle. Upon arriving, Charlotte calls out to her parents and tells them that Morris is innocent. Thinking it is a trick, the Guards demand she show herself. Charlotte reveals herself and everyone is scared. The Guards are about to seize her but Charlotte insists that she is the Princess and tells them about the curse and its reason for being put on her. She then tells Morris that she now understands how terrible it is to be treated like something that cannot think or feel, and that judging others according to their looks and what others say is wrong. She apologizes to Morris, which breaks the curse and returns Charlotte to her true form and Morris thanks Charlotte for standing up for him. She then invites Morris to the Summer Ball. Charlotte thanks Sofia for her help and invites her to the ball too, but with her job done, Sofia's Amulet teleports her home. When Sofia gets home, she tells Clover everything, while back at Isleworth Castle, Charlotte and Morris dance at the Summer Ball."

      "Two to Tangu": " Sofia, Amber and James, along with everyone from Royal Prep, visit Zandar in the Kingdom of Tangu. He tells everyone that they will be riding flying carpets to Tangu Peak for a big party. Sofia asks Amber if she would like to ride with her, but she seems hesitant and tries to make up excuses about why she should not, until finally admitting that she is scared because it is not the same as riding in a flying coach and she has never ridden a Flying Carpet before. Sofia keeps pleading for her to give the carpet a try until she finally relents on the condition that if she does not like it they will take the coach back. With that settled, they get on board but instantly have trouble controlling the carpet. It flies through a bunch of trees and a flock of flying horses before dropping the girls in front of a town. Sofia says they can ask someone for directions, in order to make it to the party, but Amber is less optimistic. The other kids are still on their way to the peak. Hildegard is not very impressed with the flying carpets, so Zandar has them perform tricks that only the carpets can do. While Hildegard admits that was fun, it was not awesome. James notices that Sofia and Amber are not around, but Zandar assumes that they are exploring Tangu. Back in the town, Sofia is amazed by what she sees, but all Amber cares about is getting directions. A nearby fortune teller beckons them to come over so she can read their fortunes, and Sofia asks if she knows the way to Tangu Peak. After telling them how to get to the peak, she says there is a lot of running in their future, since their carpet just took off. The girls chase after it and end up at a carpet stall, but luckily their carpet shows itself so they do not have to search through all of them. However, it refuses to be caught, and even takes Amber's tiara which makes her finally lose her temper and get violent with the carpet. Eventually, Amber manages to catch it and get her tiara back, and the girls leave town. They eventually come across the Hanging Gardens, which the fortune teller mentioned as part of the directions, but instead of continuing towards the peak, the carpet crashes in through the gardens. While Amber tries to keep the still-unruly carpet under control, Sofia looks for a way out but cannot seem to find one. Zandar is showing the group around and brings them to see the dancing elephants. Again, Hildegard is not impressed, until the elephants dance in the air on flying carpets, but it is still not awesome to her. But Zandar refuses to give up on truly impressing her. Sofia discovers a tunnel and looks around, but there is still no way out of the gardens. She now feels hopeless when suddenly her amulet begins to glow, summoning Princess Jasmine to help the two princesses. She shows Sofia and Amber the way out, but it is way up high, and Sofia says they cannot reach it since they cannot control their carpet. Jasmine takes a look at the carpet and says it is wild. She explains that carpets are like horses, so like a wild horse, a wild carpet needs to be tamed before it will listen to someone. Also, if the carpet senses the rider is afraid, it would not trust the rider to tell it where to go. Taking Jasmine's advice, Sofia and Amber fearlessly work together to direct the carpet and are finally in control. Jasmine flies alongside on them on her own carpet, and the three of them get out of the gardens. Sofia thanks Jasmine for rescuing them, but she says all she did was help them rescue themselves, before flying off through the desert while the girls wave goodbye. Zandar declares he has saved the best attraction for last, which is having everyone dance to exotic music, and Hildegard is finally impressed enough to consider it \"awesome\". James does not understand why out of everything they have done today, this is what she considers \"awesome\". Zandar explains that the only thing that would impress Hildegard is something she's the star of. Sofia and Amber finally reach the peak, but everyone is leaving, meaning the party is over. Sofia sadly apologizes to Amber for ruining the day for her, by making her go through all that trouble with the carpet, but Amber says she had a great day - they tamed a flying carpet, got to see the whole kingdom and met Jasmine. She also thanks Sofia for making her ride the carpet, so she could learn not to be scared of trying new things. After explaining to Zandar and James that they just got a little lost but had quite the adventure, Zandar says there is going to be a concert back at the palace. Sofia tells Amber they can take the coach to the palace if she wants, but Amber would rather take the carpet, and this time they enjoy the trip."

      "The Tale of the Noble Knight": " While taking Minimus out for a ride, Sofia's amulet starts to glow blue. She is needed at the Secret Library once again. She arrives at the library, just in time to catch the book that has the next story she needs to finish. It is called \"The Tale of the Noble Knight\", which tells the story of Brazendell, a faraway kingdom where people and dragons lived in harmony until one day, for reasons unknown, the Dragons began setting fires all over the land. The King of Brazendell declared that whoever could stop the dragons would be named First Knight, leader of all knights. Sir Oliver, the strongest and bravest all knights, vowed to defeat the dragons and become First Knight. To do this, he has to seek the magical Ice Fire Shield, which had the power to freeze dragon fire. As the story goes, the shield can only be found by following a trail of riddles and clues. However, a rival knight named Sir Jaxon also wants the shield, so he sets out to trap Sir Oliver. Sofia’s task is to help the noblest knight find the Ice Fire Shield. Sofia and Minimus set out to Brazendell and soon find Sir Oliver. Upon meeting him, they find Sir Oliver to be very conceited and arrogant. Sofia and Minimus begin to show disapproving faces, especially when he openly looks down on them after saying they have come to assist him on his quest. Suddenly, Sir Oliver’s arrogance gets himself caught in a trap, despite Sofia’s warning. She helps Sir Oliver out of the trap, and then see Sir Jaxon waiting for them. Sir Oliver draws his sword and the two knights engage in a fight. Sofia tries to get them to stop but neither one of them listens, until she stands in the way when Sir Jaxon has Sir Oliver defenseless. She manages to get the two knights to call it a truce, but as they shake on it Sir Oliver goes back on his word and locks him up. He then proceeds in searching for clues that will lead them to the Ice Fire Shield. But then he gets distracted by admiring his reflection in a mirror, so Sofia looks for the clues herself. She finds a stained glass window hidden behind a portrait. She discovers a riddle on it as well, and following her own line of reasoning it instructs them to look through a hole in the window where they can see a rock across the valley made out of gold. They head out immediately and leave Sir Jaxon trapped in the tower, despite Sofia’s concerns. Arriving at the golden rock, Minimus and Sofia are beginning to dislike Sir Oliver, but since the book says he is the noble knight, Sofia has to help him. While searching for clues, Sofia and Minimus find another riddle carved in the rock. According to Sofia, the riddle instructs them to look through a hole that shows a cave across the valley, where the Ice Fire Shield is hidden. Just then, they spot Sir Jaxon coming in their direction. Sir Oliver decides to wash him away by opening a nearby dam, despite Sofia’s objections. He releases the water and Sir Jackson makes a run for it. While Sir Oliver proceeds to the cave, Sofia and Minimus decide to rescue Sir Jaxon. They arrive just in time to airlift him to safety. Afterwards, they are cornered by the dragons of Brazendell and discover that they are very friendly and friends of Sir Jaxon’s. Sofia also discovers that the reason the dragons have been setting fires to the kingdom is because Sir Oliver had been starting fights with them just to make them look bad and make himself look like a hero. This makes Sofia realize that Sir Jaxon is the noble knight that she is supposed to help, not Sir Oliver. Together, they fly to the cave in hopes of stopping Sir Oliver. But they are too late, as Sir Oliver has already found the shield. The dragons attack him with their fire breath, but Sir Oliver uses the shield to block their attacks and turn their flames into ice. Sir Jaxon goes in to distract Sir Oliver, giving Sofia the chance to swipe the shield from his clutches. Sir Oliver has been beaten and the King of Brazendell arrives. Sofia and Sir Jaxon tell the king about Sir Oliver’s deception. Disgusted by this, the king banishes Sir Oliver from the kingdom and rewards Sir Jaxon with the Ice Fire Shield as well as the title of First Knight. Another unfinished story is given a happy ending."

      "Forever Royal": " Sofia and Miranda are riding in the Royal Coach to Dunwiddie Village. They arrive at the shoe shop that used to be their home before they moved into the castle. Inside, Miranda suprises Sofia with a lovely pink dress and matching shoes she made for her graduation from Royal Prep. Sofia loves it and changes into her new dress. Afterwards, the pair head back to Enchancia Castle. Sofia cannot believe today is her last day at Royal Prep. Miranda states that she cannot believe she went to Royal Prep or that she is a Queen, noting they have come a long way, to which Sofia sighs. When Miranda asks what's wrong, Sofia explains that the other students want her to make a speech at graduation and she does not know the right thing to say is on such a big day. Miranda assures her she will do fine. Roland, Amber, and James are excited about graduation and the Royal Family heads to the coach. Just as Sofia is about to enter the coach, however, Chrysta and Skye show up and tell her she needs to go to the Mystic Isles: Azurine has spotted Prisma on the Isle of Crystals. Sofia tells Amber, who agrees to cover for her. Sofia, Skye, and Chrysta then head to the Mystic Isles. On the way, Sofia finds it odd that Prisma would go to the Isle of Crystals since the Wicked Nine are all in the Protectors' Castle on the Isle of Protectors. Sofia quickly realizes that her sighting on the Isle of Crystal is a decoy to lure the Protectors away while she obtains the Wicked Nine once they are unguarded. Chrysta assures Sofia that Garish was left behind to guard the Protectors' Vault, which has an unbreakable lock. Sofia reminds her that Prisma has her Neccesi-Key and might break into the Vault with it. Sofia, Skye, and Chrysta then head to the Protectors Castle where, sure enough, Prisma has broken into the Vault after having Wormwood and Twitch distract Garish. Prisma then sets in motion her plan to absorb the magic of the Wicked Nine. Using their Enchantlets, Sofia and Chrysta finally stop Prisma and recapture her. Sofia even gets her Nessci-Key back. Orion and Vega arrive with the other Protectors, who take Prisma away to imprison again. Orion notes that the Locket of Vor has been destroyed and hopes Vor is destroyed too. When Sofia asks who Vor is, Orion explains to her that she is an evil sorceress who tried to use her magic ring to conquer every single Realm eons ago. The Protectors stopped her and imprisoned her spirit inside her locket. They then divided up her Ring and sealed them inside the Wicked Nine. Sofia wonders if that was why Prisma was seeking the Wicked Nine. Vega reminds her that Prisma just wanted all of that power for herself. However, Vega also states that if Prisma had completed the spell, Vor would have been released. Sofia heads back to the EverRealm to attend her graduation. At Royal Prep, everyone is wondering where Sofia is. Amber assures everyone that she is on her way. Sofia arrives on Skye and finds Desmond, who is afraid to give his speech as the valedictorian. Sofia pulls him to the stage and they give their speeches together, to everyone's joy. Back on the Mystic Isles, Twitch and Wormwood visit Prisma in her cell. Prisma is furious that she came so far just to fail. Suddenly, Vor's spirit appears before Prisma. It turns out that she did complete the spell and freed Vor. She hands Prisma her Ring. The second she puts it on, Vor enters Prisma and becomes flesh and blood again, taking Prisma's body as her own. Vor reveals that she was using Prisma to get what she needed to resurrect herself. Now that she is restored, she now plans to get her revenge on the Protectors and Sofia. Wormwood and Twitch pledge themselves to her. Vor turns Twitch into a black unicorn and the three villains fly to the Protectors' castle. Revealing herself, Vor then imprisons the Protectors. Back at Royal Prep, everyone is preparing to go home. Vivian is sad since they will be going to different schools. Amber tells her they will all still be friends. Everyone then leaves to go to the party. Clover comes up to congratulate Sofia, when all the sudden she gets a call from Chrysta. She informs her of Vor's release and the imprisonment of the Protectors. Sofia asks Amber to cover for her again and then heads to the Mystic Isles with Clover on Skye. On the Mystic Isles, it is revealed that Vor has Chrysta under a mind control spell and her call was to lure Sofia into a trap. Vor plans to conquer the EverRealm starting with the Kingdom of Enchancia. Sofia, Clover, and Skye arrive at the Protectors' Castle. Orion and the other Protectors warn her about Vor's trap. Sofia and Clover stop in time, but Skye falls into the trap: a magical glowing barrier that keeps anything from getting out of it. Chrysta reveals the real purpose of her call earlier. Vega tells Sofia that Vor's goal is to spread evil everywhere she goes and is heading for Enchancia. Orion also warns her that Vor's going to seal the gate to the Mystic Isles and if she does not get through in time, she will be trapped in the Isles forever. With Skye trapped, Sofia turns herself into a Flying Unicorn and heads to the gate. Sure enough, Vor has cast a spell to seal the gates. Thanks to her Flying Unicorn form, Sofia gets through just in time. Sofia and Clover also find Vor just in time to see her conjure a legion of Crystal Soldiers. Sofia and Clover feel they cannot handle this on their own and fly off to go get more help. At Enchancia Castle, Baileywick and Cedric are getting the castle ready for the party. Miranda notices that Sofia is missing, only for Amber to state that she is running an errand. In return, James remarks that Sofia has been running a lot of errands lately. Meanwhile, Vivian, Desmond, Ruby, and Jade are on their way to the party at Enchancia Castle, when all of a sudden the quartet spots a pink unicorn. The unicorn is revealed to be Sofia when she changes back into herself, to everyone's shock. They ask her how she did that to which Sofia reveals the truth about her Amulet. She then tells them about Vor. The quartet agrees to help Sofia as she is always been there for them. In Dunwiddie Village, the group unleashes an ambush on Vor and her minions, while Clover and Crackle deal with Wormwood and Twitch. Vor overpowers them with her magic. Lucinda shows up to help, but Vor is still too powerful. Sofia urges her friends to go to the castle and warn her family. However, her friends insist her to do that as they still want to help. Unfortunately, after Sofia leaves, Vor easily subdues them with her hypnois spell, forcing them to tell her where Sofia is going. On her way back to the castle, Sofia tries to summon Minimus, when Vor appears right in front of her. Sofia uses her Enchantlet to lasso Vor's wrist, but Vor snaps the rope, causing Sofia to lose her balance and fall off the bridge. Luckily, Minimus arrives, catches Sofia on his back, and flies her to safety. They try to sneak into the castle to warn her family, but Vor begins placing her powerful curse over it. Seeing how badly they are outmatched, Minimus tells Sofia he knows a perfect place to hide, and the two make a hasty retreat. Watching the heroes fly into the distance, Wormwood volunteers to go after them, but Vor states it will not be necessary, as she intends for Sofia to hopelessly watch as she takes away everything she owns and loves. Inside the castle, Vor and her army of Crystal Soldiers burst into the ballroom. Cedric tries to fight back, but Wormwood takes his wand, enabling Vor to take him and the Royal Family prisoners after ensnaring them in her hypnosis spell. She even forces King Roland to take his crown off for Vor to burn to signify the end of Roland's reign. Meanwhile, Sofia and Minimus have retreated to the Secret Library. Sofia discovers Vor's conquest in the distance and feels like all hope is lost. Suddenly, her Amulet glows blue. A book called The Tale of Princess Sofia is selected. The book goes through the pendulum and the Narrator tells Sofia her latest story: Once, there was a young girl named Sofia. She lived in the village with her mother, Miranda, and was happy, but missed her father, a sailor, who had been lost at sea. In the nearby castle lived King Roland II, who had wanted a family so badly he tried making a wish in a wishing well. The wish came true and twins were born. But the Queen fell gravely ill. The children were happy, but never knew what it was like to have a mother. Until one day, King Roland and Miranda fell in love and married. Sofia treasured her new family more than anything and she also became a Princess with the responsibility to protect her family, friends, and all those who dwelt in her Kingdom. So when the day came that the evil Vor took everything Sofia held dear, the young Princess was faced with her biggest challenge yet. Sofia sadly notes she already tried to give this story a happy ending and she failed. The Narrator reminds Sofia that she is the Storykeeper. Suddenly, the pendulum then turns into a man who is revealed to be the narrator--the first Storykeeper. He explains that he built the Secret Library centuries ago and filled it with several books that remained unfinished and that Sofia is one of the few who has been able to follow in his footsteps so magnificently. The Narrator then reminds Sofia that all she loves is in danger and only she can save them. However, he also explains that she must be willing to face this evil on her own and be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. He then disappears. Encouraged by the Narrator, Sofia decides to return to save her family. She tells Minimus that she must go alone to sneak unoticed. However, she tells him to go to the village to make sure their friends are alright and then to the harbor to wait for her, but she warns him to stay away from the castle. Minimus wishes Sofia good luck as she leaves the Library to rescue her family. Reaching the castle, Sofia uses several clever methods to sneak inside without getting caught. First, she turns herself into a mermaid to swim back to the passageway in her room. She then enters her room with her shrinking ability. After that, she uses the Whichway Bow to find her family in Cedric's tower. Robin and Mia show up. After explaining what is going on, Sofia turns into a bird. After sending her bird friends to get help, Sofia flies into Cedric's tower. She manages to break the spell Vor cast on her family and friends, and breaks them out. When they get to the harbor, they board one of the Royal Yachts to escape. Roland intends to get his family to safety before returning to retake the kingdom, but Sofia tells her father she must stay, stating that \"family\" is not just those related to him, but also the entire kingdom. Roland agrees, but he still refuses to turn back because of the huge danger Vor possesses. But Amber sticks up for her sister, stating she is willing to protect her future subjects from any threat. Sofia turns into a Flying Horse and Amber rides her back to the castle. When they arrive back at the castle, Sofia and Amber, after remembering how Elena was trapped inside the Amulet of Avalor, decide to trap Vor inside it as well. The sisters sneak inside the castle to find Vor plotting to make her next conquest on Neverland, then the real world through the second star to the right to complete her conquest. Sofia activates the amulet's power to trap Vor inside, but Vor snatches her by the ankle, intent on dragging her inside with her. Amber grabs Sofia's hand to save her, but the force is too strong. The two sisters' hands break apart, and Sofia is sucked into the Amulet with Vor. However, with Vor trapped inside the Amulet, the effects of her magic get undone; the cursed barrier imprisoning the Protectors disappears and the people of the castle and the village are freed from the spell. Cedric arrives with the rest of the Royal Family and subdues Twitch and Wormwood. Roland, Miranda, James, Grand Mum, and Tilly ask where Sofia is. Amber sombrely tells them that she is trapped in the Amulet with Vor. Inside the Amulet, Vor quickly gains the upper hand on Sofia and prepares to finish her off. But Sofia stands tall after seeing the spirits of the Disney Princesses who had been summoned in her times of need. They encourage her to be brave and strong for they all believe in her. With their support, Sofia lets the bright light of goodness in her heart shine on Vor, causing the evil sorceress to dissolve into nothingness, destroying her permanently and leaving Prisma, freed from her control, in her place. Truly grateful and guilt-ridden for what happened, Prisma apologizes to Sofia for everything she has done. Sofia's friends, the Three Good Fairies, and the Protectors arrive at the castle. When Amber reveals what has happened, Cedric summons his parents and, with everyone's help, casts a spell that frees Sofia and Prisma, who surrenders willingly to the Protectors. A relieved Miranda hugs her daughter. Orion declares Sofia an official Protector of the EverRealm, and he and the other Protectors award Sofia her new Protector uniform. Cedric gives Sofia back her Amulet. Roland thanks Cedric for his help in saving his step-daughter and tells him that, from now on, he will be called \"Cedric the Great\". As everyone else goes inside for the graduation party, Sofia and Amber embrace each other. Sofia tells Amber that she will make a great queen, dubbing her \"Amber the First\". The two sisters then go inside to join the celebration."

      "The Amulet of Avalor": " Sofia is getting ready for another royal ball and her animal friends help her get ready. Roland comes in, saying he has a surprise for her and Amber. He takes them to the Royal Treasure Room where, as a treat, they can each pick out a piece of jewelry for the ball. While looking, Sofia comes across a baby griffin. They love anything shiny and must stay in the jewel room. While everyone is leaving, the baby griffin follows without anyone noticing. In Sofia's room, Amber has an idea to trade jewels for a tryout despite Sofia warning Amber she must not take it off. She soon gives in, for one minute. The Baby Griffin sees this and swoops down and takes it, leaving scratch marks. Sofia notices that it is gone and tries to find it. Amber says it might just have fallen on the floor. Amber goes to find someone who can help, while Sofia calls her animal friends. When they try to answer, she can't hear them, realizing that without it, she can no longer talk to them as she can't understand them either. She hears a scream, and runs to where it was heard. When there, a maidservant says that when she went to set the table, the golden goblets she had settled there before leaving for other silverware went missing, leaving scratch marks and mysterious feathers. The constable comes in and when learning of this, says that there is a thief in the castle and they must find it before the ball. After Sofia tells James and Amber that they should look too, they separated. Cedric, who finds out the griffin has the amulet while collecting flowers for his potions, tries to freeze him, but fails. Amber and James, when interacting, come close to finding the baby griffin, but he hides and flies away. Later, Sofia's mother, Miranda has a tiara that went missing. Amber implies that there have been things disappearing, and after a reply when Miranda asks what else is missing, has Roland worried, because the amulet was a gift from him to Sofia. Amber and Miranda go and greet the guests while Roland explains how he chose the amulet. He was about to choose a ruby necklace when the amulet flashed, glowing faintly, and he remembered the stories that his mother, the previous bearer of the Amulet, told him about how it protects the princess who wears it and decide that that sounded like something Sofia would need. Roland comforts Sofia about its loss by saying that though he is furious at whoever took it, he would never be furious at her. They leave and go to the Ball. The King states that it will find it's way back. Meanwhile, the trap that Cedric set failed, leaving him in a cage. Cedric makes a flying machine, chasing the griffin around. Cedric is right on his tail as he drops many jewels, and they both crash into the ball room. Roland and Constable Myles think it was Cedric who stole the jewels, but it is clear that it's not when Sofia finds feathers and fur. She yells out that the theft is the griffin, which is hiding under a table. Putting two and two together all the shiny things that were missing had scratch from his claws and feathers from his wings, they find Sofia's amulet and it restores her powers. As for the griffin, he is to be taken back to his parents in the jewel room. Sofia runs pass Cedric and James asks for a ride in Cedric's machine, only it has a few bugs from when it crashed. Sofia speaks to her animals, inviting them to dinner and ending the episode."

      "The Big Sleepover": " Sofia is going to have her first Royal Slumber Party. Amber brings her to the castle's observatory, where everyone will be sleeping that night, and tells her the most important part of a Royal Slumber Party is the guests. She invited Princess Hildegard and Princess Clio, the most popular Princesses at Royal Prep, while Sofia invited her friends Ruby and Jade. Amber is shocked that Sofia would invite village girls, but Sofia tells her that Ruby and Jade are really fun to be with. Down in his lair, Cedric is visited by King Roland and Queen Miranda and is asked to put on a magic show for the girls at their party. Disgusted at having to do such a thing, he decides to use this opportunity to steal Sofia's amulet by performing a magic trick with his puppets that will make the amulet disappear right into his hands. Amber's guests Hildegard and Clio are the first to arrive at the castle and, much to their annoyance, Sofia's guests arrive soon after. When Hildegard asks if those \"village girls\" are coming to their party, Amber states that Sofia invited them, causing Hildeguard and Clio to turn and glare at her. Sofia promises that they'll see that Ruby and Jade are the best. After changing into their PJs, Ruby and Jade do a goofy dance while wearing pine cones in their hair and rapping. The Princess trio are astonished but Sofia likes what they're doing so much that she runs over and joins in. Appalled, Amber, Hildegard and Clio pull Sofia aside and tell her that at a perfect slumber party, everyone has to fit in. But Sofia disagrees saying that the point is to have fun and she will show them that Ruby and Jade can fit in, though the princesses are unconvinced. Sofia gives her friends Royal Makeovers to make them look like princesses, but they still don't really act like princesses. While painting fans, Ruby paints a smiley face on hers instead of roses like she's expected to, then Jade knocks over a display of the Solar System while playing pin-the-tail-on-the-unicorn. Before Amber can scold Sofia again for her friends' behavior, it's time for Cedric's magic show, and Sofia doesn't see how Ruby and Jade could cause trouble when all they have to do is sit and watch. Cedric's plan to steal Sofia's amulet does not work since Ruby and Jade keep interrupting his act. James enters the room and the two of them knock over the chocolate milk fountain in their rush to go over to him, getting chocolate milk all over themselves and a small amount on Amber's gown, which she throws a temper tantrum over. While Sofia's friends are getting cleaned up and Amber and her friends leave to go to the ballroom, Sofia sadly tells James that Ruby and Jade are ruining the party and doing everything wrong, according to Amber and the princesses anyway, but James says it shouldn't matter what they think. Sofia gently tells her friends to act more like the Princesses and they promise to, but they are no longer having fun and end up just sitting and watching the others dance. Eventually, they decide to just go home and Sofia only makes things worse when she says they were being embarrassing, to which a hurt Jade angrily responds by telling her off and saying that maybe they shouldn't be friends anymore and storms off with Ruby. The Princess trio couldn't care less that they're leaving but Sofia feels guilty for making them feel bad and goes after them, determined to apologize and set things right, but finds them already gone. Sofia is visited by her mother and tells her about failing to make her friends more like princesses, but her mother says that perhaps Sofia should be more of a princess herself, by not trying to change her friends regardless of the opinions of others. Sofia rushes to catch up with Ruby and Jade as they are leaving. She apologizes and says they can have their own slumber party with just the three of them. Amber and the princesses hear them having fun and go down to see them. Amber admits things aren't as fun without Sofia and her friends, and soon the whole group is partying together again."

      "Mom's the Word": " It's Mother's Day in the Kingdom of Enchancia and Sofia, with a pink rose in her hand, goes looking for her mom and is looking forward to spending the day with her. However, when she finds her she discovers that James and Amber have already given Miranda roses in the shape of a unicorn. She tells Sofia they're bringing James and Amber along on their Mother's Day picnic to June Berry Island. This disappoints Sofia a little because she was hoping it to be just the two of them, but Miranda reminds her she's not just her mother anymore, she's also Amber and James's mother as well. With both picnic baskets loaded onto the coach the Royal Family get on their way with Baileywick accompanying them. Sofia is still feeling disappointed, and can't bear looking at Amber next to her mother. Just then she spots a witch in the sky who turns the right rear wheel of the coach into a watermelon. While everyone inspects the damage, Sofia spots the witch again and decides to go and investigate. She calls and calls until the witch comes up behind her and puts a hex on her gown just before Lucinda the Good Little Witch appears. After undoing the hex on Sofia, she tells her that the other witch is her mother and every Mother's Day they go out hexing people and since she's now a good witch she finds it no fun. However, her mother doesn't know she's a good witch now and doesn't want to ruin her special day. Sofia can understand her feelings and she recalls the times when it was just her and her mom and sometimes wishes it could be just the two of them again. Seeing that Sofia really wants to be alone with her mother, Lucinda comes up with a magical idea that will get the two of them alone. As soon as the coach is mended, the family gets back on their way and arrive at the Royal River. Sofia, in a rush, gets her mother into the boat just as they start putting on their life jackets. Then unnoticed, the two witches fly over and Lucinda magically summons two giant seahorses that push the boat out into the river without James and Amber. Marla is impressed with her daughter's hex until Lucinda admits it was actually a good spell. Marla tells her that being wicked is more fun than being good and it's part of their legacy of being witches. Lucinda reluctantly understands and just before the two witches fly away she makes the two seahorses pushing Sofia and Miranda's boat disappear. Sofia sees they are close to June Berry Island but Miranda insists that they turn around and go back for Amber and James, feeling worried about those witches on the loose. Amber, James and Baileywick remain back at the dock and decide to go after them. But since they lost their boat they decide to borrow a fishing boat, much to Amber's dismay. As Miranda and Sofia continue to row back, Marla creates rapids and sends them off on a wild ride. Marla is really enjoying herself but Luncinda isn't. She tries to undo the spell but her mother's hex is too powerful for her to undo. Sofia and Miranda, at first, find this wild ride scary but they soon find it really fun and happily slide through the rapids till they make it out to calm waters. Meanwhile, James, Amber, and Baileywick are slowly rowing after Miranda and Sofia when suddenly the witches appear again and Marla turns their boat into a giant lily pad and Baileywick into a frog, to his and Amber's horror. Sofia and Miranda make it to June Berry Island. much to Sofia's joy. She hopes they can have their picnic now but Miranda tells her they can't. She can see that Sofia has been trying to get some time alone with her but she needs to learn that she is now Amber and James' mother too and things can't always be the same as they were before. Just then Amber, James and Baileywick show up and the family is reunited. Meanwhile flying in the sky, Marla notices Lucinda is feeling bothered and Lucinda admits she's not having fun. So Marla decides to turn things up a notch by causing June Berry Island to rise out of the water with the Royals still on it. Sofia and her family try to bring the island to the ground by lassoing some rope to a tree on the mainland and pulling hard to bring the island down. However, their attempts fail when Baileywick once again gets the urge to eat a fly. Finally, Lucinda has had enough and confesses to her mother that she is now a good witch and wants to do good spells from now on. Marla is shocked to hear this and, thinking she doesn't understand, Lucinda leaves to go and help Sofia and her family. Still floating above the water, Sofia admits that the little witch is her friend and she asked her to cast a spell that would get her and her mother alone. Everyone is shocked to hear that Sofia would do such a thing. Miranda asks for an explanation and Sofia admits that she wanted it to be just the two of them like before but she realizes that she was not being a good sister or a good daughter and apologizes for her actions. Just then, Lucinda appears; at first everyone is cautious except Sofia who tells them she is a good witch. Lucinda promises to get them down but again her mother's hex is too powerful for her to undo. Then, her mother shows up and brings them down safely. Marla finally understands Lucinda wasn't really enjoying their day together because she was doing bad spells and she has chosen to be a good witch. So she decided to do a good spell for her “Little Witchlet”. She promises Lucinda that if being a good witch is what she wants to be then she is willing to support her decision. With everybody happy and Baileywick changed back the two families spend the rest of Mother's Day having a picnic together."

      "The Mystic Isles": " At the Castle, Amber is having her room redecorated. She has the servants rearrange a tapestry before eventually deciding to have them simply hang it in the other room. After they leave, Amber notices a tile on the wall the tapestry was on. As she inspects it, Amber causes the wall to swing and finds herself in a secret passageway. Amber goes down a flight of stairs where she finds another passage with stairs and an underground river. Suddenly, she hears someone's footsteps and goes to hide. The somebody turns out to be Sofia with Behind the Walls in her hand. They are in the secret passage that leads to the Secret Library. Amber confronts Sofia who is shocked to find her. She insists that she go back, however Amber is adamant on finding out where they are and what Sofia is doing, which Sofia cannot say. Suddenly, Sofia's Amulet glows blue. Sofia tries to hide it from Amber, but it is already too late. When the crystalline boat appears, Amber deduces that it is magical. As she climbs into the boat, Sofia tells Amber that she does not have time to explain as she really has to get somewhere. She again tells Amber to go back, but her big sister instead gets into the boat as well. She refuses to leave until Sofia tells her everything. Unable to talk her out of it, Sofia reluctantly explains her role as the Storykeeper during the boat ride to the Secret Library. Upon entering the Library, Sofia and Amber sit down to receive Sofia's latest story. The Library selects a story called The Tale of the Crystalmasters. The book goes inside the pendulum and the narrator tells them the story about the legendary Mystic Isles, a place made up of countless floating islands homed to different magical creatures and objects. As the story goes, the Crystalmasters on the Isle of Crystals have peacefully grown magical crystals for wizards everywhere to use in their scepters, wands, and amulets for centuries. However, one Crystalmaster has a wicked plan to grow magic crystals on the other Mystic Isles, which could drain all the magic from the creatures who live there forever. When Amber asks where the rest of the story is, Sofia again reminds her of her role as the Storykeeper before telling her she has to go to the Mystic Isles and give this story a happy ending. Amber wants to come along as she wants a magical amulet of her own so she can have her own special adventures. Sofia tells Amber she cannot come by reminding her that she is the Storykeeper and what she is out to do will be dangerous. Amber appeals to her little sister's sense of fairness which makes Sofia concede. Suddenly, the magical elevator drops down and the two girls ride it to the Mystic Isles. The elevator drops them off at a giant dandelion patch where they meet a girl named Prisma, who used to be a Crystalmaster until her sister Azurine took her powers away. Amber deduces that Azurine is the evil Crystalmaster they need to stop, and Prisma tells them they can get to the Mystic Isles if Sofia uses her Amulet to summon unicorns. Sofia does so and three unicorns come down to take them there. Amber is shocked that the unicorns can talk, to which Prisma reveals that all the animals from the Mystic Isles are able to talk. The unicorns fly the trio to the Mystic Isles, and drop them off on the Isle of Unicorns. Upon arrival, they meet a newly-winged unicorn named Skye, who gets stuck in a tree after failing to teach himself how to fly. After Sofia gets him out, he pledges to help her with her quest before giving Sofia and Amber a tour of the Mystic Isles. The group arrives at the Isle of Dancing Deserts, which is the last Isle they need to cross to get to the Isle of Crystals. During the trek, Prisma and Skye reveal that the Dancing Deserts are so named because they reveal what one desires. Hearing this, Amber asks the desert to show her a magical jewel. It gives her an orange crystal that Amber fails to get powers from. Amber is so annoyed by this, that when they get to the bridge they need to cross, Amber strikes the bridge with the jewel three times. This causes the bridge to collapse in a way that makes Sofia fall off. She gets saved by a man with wings who then saves the others. Prisma raises her hood and looks at the man in fear. The man introduces himself as Orion and tells them that he is a Windwalker and one of the Protectors, the group who protects everyone on the Mystic Isles from harm. Orion then tells Amber that her magical jewel is a Shatter Stone, a magical rock that destroys anything it gets struck three times against. Hearing this, Amber puts the Stone back. Orion informs them that he is looking for the evil Crystalmaster to which Sofia reveals she is the Storykeeper and is going to the Isle of Crystals to stop her. Orion informs her the villainess was not there when he looked and urges her to keep an eye out. Sofia is confused until Prisma dismisses Orion's claim by saying that her sister is cunning and thus could've fooled Orion and insists that they continue onward to the Isle of Crystals. With the bridge gone, they now have to go through the Isle of Rompkins. Once there, they get captured by the Rompkins, who trick Amber into putting a crown on her head and becoming their Queen. To get away, Sofia and Amber get them to let them go by teaching them manners. The Rompkins release them and wish them luck. The next day, the group finally arrive on the Isle of Crystals. Prisma points out Azurine and the tower where she locked up Prisma's Terra Crystal, the magical tool Crystalmasters use to perform their magic. After Skye fails to fly yet again, Sofia uses her Animal Transformation power to turn herself into a Crystal Bird. She flies into the tower and succeeds in getting the Terra Crystal, but gets trapped in a net. Azurine sees and goes to her aid. Prisma convinces Amber that Sofia is in danger, and promises to give her an amulet as special as Sofia's if she gets her Terra Crystal. Meanwhile, Azurine's kind treatment makes Sofia realize that Azurine is not what Prisma said she is and makes her suspect that Prisma is not what she seems. Sofia tries to warn her big sister, but Amber, blinded by her own envy and greed, ignores her little sister and gives Prisma her Terra Crystal. Prisma uses the Crystal's magic to return to her true form. Revealing herself to be the real evil Crystalmaster, Prisma declares that the magic of the Mystic Isles will be all hers. Azurine arrives and Prisma uses her magic to trap her inside a crystalline cage, Horrified, Sofia asks Prisma why she's doing this and Prisma explains how she always felt overshadowed by her sister and wants to be the greatest Crystalmaster ever, even if that means harming the other inhabitants of the Mystic Isles. Prisma gives Amber an amulet before sending her, Sofia, and Skye plunging down a Crystal Vortex. Sofia uses her Animal Transformation power to turn herself into a Flying Unicorn and helps Skye fly down. Amber tries to follow suit only to discover that her amulet is not magical. When they land safely, Amber voices how terrible things are. Sofia agrees stating that Prisma has to be stopped, only for Amber to reveal she is just upset that her amulet is not magical. Disgusted, Sofia angrily reminds her that it was her desire that caused this situation. Amber retorts that she made an honest mistake due to thinking Prisma was their friend, to which Sofia snaps that she tried to warn her not to give Prisma her Crystal. Skye breaks up the argument and reminds them of the mission. Sofia agrees and is determined to stop Prisma but Amber just wants to go home. Sofia tells her big sister to stop thinking of herself as everyone in the Mystic Isles need help, to which Amber states that there is still the Protectors. The group set off to find Orion. Meanwhile, Prisma uses her her magic to cover the Mystic Isles with crystals starting with the Isle of Unicorns, which the group discovers when Skye loses his wings and horn. Orion appears but he loses his wings. Harrumph the Rompkin saves him and the group tell him what is going on. Orion informs them that if they destroy her Terra Crystal all the damage will be undone. Sofia offers to help but Orion tells her to leave it to the Protectors. Amber is only too happy to seize upon the excuse to go home. However, when Prisma shrinks Harrumph and covers the Isle they are on in crystals, Sofia insists that they stop Prisma anyway. Prisma is amused that Sofia actually wants to fight her. Azurine warns her that Sofia can stop her but Prisma retorts that is impossible, as all Sofia has by her side is a unicorn that cannot fly, a shrunken Rompkin, and a big sister who is a spoiled, self-serving brat who only thinks about herself. Meanwhile, Amber tries to talk Sofia into going back but Sofia insists on the ground that it is the right thing to do. Amber voices her fear of not feeling up to it only for Sofia to state she is, by reminding of times she has saved the day and together they set off to stop Prisma. To destroy Prisma's Terra Crystal, the group set out to obtain a Shattering Stone. Prisma tries to stop them by covering the Isle of Dancing Deserts in Crystals but the group keeps going, since the Stone's magic is not drained due to being made on another Isle. Since she cannot remember which Isle that was, Prisma traps them inside crystal cages. Sofia gets out of hers by using her Shrinking ability and, upon obtaining a Shattering Stone, frees the others. When they arrive at Prisma's home, Amber distracts Prisma by making her give her amulet powers, such as the ability to conjure mirrors, while Sofia frees Azurine with the Stone. Azurine and Prisma fight and Prisma only wins when she makes it so Azurine cannot use her wand. Sofia charges at Prisma and hits her Terra Crystal twice with the Stone before getting trapped too. While Harrumph retrieves the Stone, Prisma tries to zap Amber, who uses her Mirror Conjuring ability to reflect her attack and trap her before taking the Stone from Harrumph. Prisma tries to dissuade Amber from using the Stone by reminding her she will lose her powers. Amber uses the Stone to destroy her Terra Crystal anyway, the Crystals are gone, and Prisma's powers are destroyed. Prisma runs for it and Sofia and Skye give chase, during which Skye finally becomes able to fly. The pair nab Prisma just as the Protectors arrive. As Prisma is taken away, she looks back at Sofia and swears revenge on her; telling her that it's all her fault and vowing not to forget it. The Protectors are impressed with Sofia and recruit her to become a Protector of the EverRealm. After Sofia accepts, The Protectors tell her they will send word of when her training will begin before ordering her to return to Enchancia. Sofia picks up Amber and the two sisters go home with Skye on the scenic route."

      "Four's a Crowd": " Clover is in the Royal Cabbage Patch and is about to help himself to a little lunch when suddenly a flying coach comes in, much to Sofia’s delight. She tells him that she and Amber are going to decorate it and ride it in the Flylight Pageant: a holiday where, on the first night of summer, flying coaches from every Kingdom come together and soar across the twilight sky in a magical parade near the stars. Sofia recalls the times when she and her friends used to watch the Pageant together, eating gooseberry pie and drinking cherry cider. Now that Sofia is a Princess herself, she gets to be part of the pageant. However, that means she won’t get to watch it with Jade and Ruby like she used to, so Clover suggests that she invite them to ride with her as her special guests. Sofia flies to the village and finds Jade and Ruby. She tells them about the Pageant and asks if they like to help decorate the coach and ride with her which they happily accept. However, Amber isn't aware of Sofia’s plans and after being told about it she, at first, disagrees with Jade and Ruby being part of the Pageant and helping out. But that soon changes when they come up with a perfect idea for the coach: Decorate it as a tree and dress up like birds. They soon begin work on decorating the coach in flowers, ribbons and glitter. Sofia is happy that Amber, Jade and Ruby are getting along because she had feared Amber would be nasty to them. As Sofia is decorating one side of the coach she hears her big sister and friends giggling on the other side. When she goes over to see what they're doing she finds them wearing fairy wings, pretending to be enchanted fairies in the garden. Sofia makes wings of her own so she can join in only to find them now wearing crowns and pretending to be Queens. Before Sofia can even try to join in, the three of them move on to putting glitter on the coach. Sofia is hurt that her friends didn't include her in their fun but tries to be happy for them. Clover can tell that something is bothering her and, after she admits it, he tells her about his friends Stu and Cheeks and how they left him out by sneaking into the Royal Cabbage Patch without him. Because of Clover's story, Sofia becomes jealous of Amber and afraid that Ruby and Jade don't want to be her friends anymore, but she decides to try and make sure she's not left out. They go to see Madame Collette and ask her to make their costumes. Sofia picks out orange for Ruby and blue for Jade since those are their favorite colors but Amber switches out those colors for red for Ruby and green for Jade which the pair declare their new favorite colors, much to Sofia's dismay. Sofia decides that she just needs to spend some time alone with Ruby and Jade without Amber and, knowing that Amber usually sleeps in, she goes to her mother and asks her if she can invite Jade and Ruby over for breakfast extra early. When Miranda asks why, Sofia tries to put on a brave face but Miranda sees through her daughter's excuses and manages to get the truth out of her. Miranda tries to tell Sofia that she has nothing to worry about by telling her \"the more the merrier\" but Sofia still insists on inviting them over which Miranda agrees on letting her do, pleased that Sofia's trying to handle her jealousy in a mature and responsible manner. Ruby and Jade arrive the next day, the day of the Flylight Pageant. Sofia is looking forward to spending some time alone with them but to her shock, Amber arrives because she was too excited about the Pageant to sleep in as usual. The four of them go to change into the costumes Madame Collette made for them. While Sofia changes into her costume she hears Ruby and Jade teaching Amber their hand clap, the special thing she and her friends created, which pushes Sofia past the point of no return. Later, Ruby, Jade, and Amber are outside decorating the coach when they notice that Sofia's been gone for hours. he reason for this is because Sofia has decided to serve Jade and Ruby some gooseberry pie and cherry cider to remind them of all the fun times they had together so they'll want to be her friends again. She puts a ton of gooseberry pies and cherry cider onto a serving trolley but she rushes so much that she loses control, causing the trolley to crash into the coach and ruin it. With the coach ruined, the flight in the Pageant seems unlikely, much to everyone's disappointment. Amber angrily turns to her little sister demanding an explanation and after a while of reluctance, Sofia finally tells her big sister and friends what's been bothering her. Ruby and Jade just smile and assure her they will always be friends, even when they make a new friend they would never leave her out. Amber also assures her little sister that she had nothing to worry about and understands how she feels because she felt the same way when Sofia first came to the castle and hearing all this makes Sofia feel better. With Sofia at peace with herself, the four of them manage to fix the coach by dressing it up like a real tree and then head to the Flylight Pageant. During the Pageant, the quartet create a new special hand clap."

      "Sidekick Clio": " At Royal Prep, the students are giving Hildegard, who is going on vacation for a week, a going away party planned by Princess Clio. After putting her going away presents in her flying coach, Hildegard flies way, leaving Clio sad. In the auditorium, the students meet their new theater teacher, Miss Elodie. She announces that they are doing Hello Polly, a musical about a parrot searching for a runaway sister, and gives everyone lists of assignments and tells them that tryouts are Friday. Clio offers to help Sofia get ready for the play since she doesn't know what to do with herself with Hildegard gone. Sofia arrives at the Royal Palace of Corinthia and discovers sides of Clio she has not shown because of Hildegard and, through a duet, discovers Clio's talents. Clio tells Sofia that she does everything Hildegard wants because she's her best friend. Hildegard has never let Clio do what she likes just because she herself does not like it. Sofia tells Clio that she should do something she wants to do and that just because Hildegard is her best friend, it does not mean Clio has to do everything Hildegard wants. Meanwhile, Roland enlists Cedric to help James with the stage effects, to the sorcerer's annoyance. Sofia gets Clio to sing in front of Miss Elodie who insists that she take part in the school play. However, Hildegard comes back early due to a warm spell in North Freezenberg. She is furious that Clio and Sofia are trying out for the play and demands that Clio choose between her and the play despite Sofia disagreeing. Predictably, Clio chooses Hildegard, to Sofia's disappointment. Amber helps Sofia bring Hildegard and Clio inside the auditorium, where Hildegard is furious that Amber brought her in the theater, so Miss Elodie could get Clio to try out. Sofia tells Clio that she can make her own choices, but Hildegard insists that Clio cannot. However, fed up with being bossed around, Clio insists on trying out for the play much to Hildegard's chagrin. Hildegard protests that she and Clio do everything together, and Clio points out that they always do everything Hildegard wants to do, and now Clio wants to do her own thing. Hildegard is angry that Clio is doing her own thing, and storms off. Amber follows and tells her that Clio has made her choice, and that now she has too choose if having a best friend is truly more important to her than always having things your way or not. Clio does the play, having gotten the lead role of Polly, with Princess Kari playing Polly's sister Molly, and the play is a success. Hildegard arrives in time for the final number and, after the play, reconciles with Clio, telling her that from now on she doesn't have to do everything she does."

      "Too Cute to Spook": " It is Halloween in the Kingdom of Enchancia. Sofia is dressed up as a griffin to go Trick or Treating with her witch friends. Calista and Cordelia are also dressed in costumes. They are heading for a party hosted by Cordelia's friend Muldo the Magnificent. Sofia compliments Calista's costume, who says she is the Giggling Goblin of Dreary Woods, a goblin whose laughs cast magic spells that he mostly uses to steal candy, which is his favorite food. Calista declares Halloween to be her favorite holiday, to which Cordelia concurs that Calista makes her read the Ghastly Guide to Halloween to her every night before bed. Calista adds that is why she wants to go Trick or Treating with Sofia and her friends instead of going to \"a boring grown-up party.\" Hearing this, Sofia asks Cordelia if Calista can go Trick or Treating with her and her friends. After Cordelia says yes, the two girls set out together in the Royal Coach. Calista is looking forward to doing everything with Sofia and her friends and hopes Sofia's witch friends will like her. Sofia and Calista arrive in Dunwiddie Village and meet up with Lucinda, dressed as a ghost, Lily, dressed as a cat, and Indigo, dressed as a ghoul. As soon as they see Calista and Sofia explains why she is here, the witches instantly have misgivings about Calista coming along with them. Indigo thinks she is too little to come with them, which Calista protests to. The witches explain to Calista that Halloween is a super special night for witches, so therefore they want to get as many \"thrills and chills\" as possible. They say Calista will get scared and walk too slow, which may keep them from all the fun. Calista states she will not get scared and can walk just as fast as them. She also adds that she knows a lot about Halloween, which Sofia confirms by telling them about how Calista reads the Ghastly Guide to Halloween every night. When Calista assures she will be handy when it comes to the scaring, the witches ask her if she knows how Trick or Treating works. Calista confirms she does: If you do a good enough scare, you get a treat but if you fail to give a scary enough scare you get a trick. The Jack O'Lanterns at each house measure how well you did. Hearing this, they agree to let her come. Sofia and Calista climb on Lucinda and Lily's brooms respectfully and the group sets off for their first stop. The group lands at Dragonhold to get candy from Merlin. After the witches see Calista try to be scary with her Giggling Goblin giggle, Lucinda asks Sofia if they should tell Calista if her Giggling Goblin giggle is more cute than scary. Sofia dismisses it as it will make her nervous. Sofia and the witches all sufficiently scare Merlin and get bat treats. However, Calista proves to be too cute to spook Merlin and gets a trick: Tremendously Tart Lemon Sours, Lemon candies that are so sour, they turn one's face yellow and make one's mouth swell up, which Calista discovers the hard way after she eats one to hide from the witches she got a trick. The group then arrives at Professor Pecullian's house. The witches hope they can scare Mr. P since he is famous for handing out the best candy. This time Calista is able to make a good enough scare by putting herself in a dragon costume that spouts out real fire and gets the same treat as the others: Pumpkin Pops which glow. Unfortunately, Calista accidentally roasts the Pops when her excitement makes her costume unleash fire by mistake, to the annoyance of the witches. Indigo asks Calista if she has had enough Halloween, but she insists that she wants to do a lot more. Sofia reminds her witch friends that there is still the Corn Maze Dash for Gummi Ghouls at Lucinda's house so, after Calista puts her Giggling Goblin costume back on, they fly off. Once they arrive, Sofia asks Calista why she is not excited about the Dash. Calista tells her she needs to show her witch friends that she is not some silly kid who messes things up. Sofia tells her she does not have to prove anything and just needs to be herself. When the other witches arrive, Calista offers to lead them through the maze. When Indigo and Lily express doubt, Calista tells them she wants to make up for destroying their Pumpking Pops, assuring them she knows the way from reading the chapter on Corn Mazes sixteen times. Sofia tells Calista she does not have to try so hard, but Calista says she does and leads the group inside. However, she leads them to a dead end. Lucinda reveals this is because Calista is using the page for a Full Moon Maze as her guide instead of the one for a Crescent Moon Maze which Marla always makes for the Corn Maze Dash. Sofia urges her to let someone else lead but Calista insists that she must get the girls their treats. Unfortunately, she just leads them right back to where they started and the other witches get the Gummi Ghouls. Indigo is so furious about this setback that she casts a spell to send Calista home. Sofia tells Indigo to undo her hex and bring Calista back, but she refuses. She states that Calista was ruining Halloween to which Lily agrees. Sofia urges her witch friends to give Calista one more chance and Indigo reluctantly brings her back. The group then steps up for the Haunted Hay Ride where they meet Sir Dax. Ghosts appear to scare the group. Calista notes to Sofia that her friends are scared, to which Sofia assures her it is the fun scared. Determined to keep anything else from being ruined, Calista, despite protests from Sofia and the witches, drives the ghosts away with dirty socks and a bright light. Unfortunately, driving the ghosts away causes the carriage to go out of control and crash in the Dreary Woods. The Haunted Hay Ride is ruined. Good and fed up, the witches all yell at Calista for ruining everything, stating this Halloween has been a big bust thanks to her. Suddenly, the group gets attacked by the Giggling Goblin. Calista has an idea, but is not sure if she should execute it. After the Goblin takes the witches' wands, Sofia encourages her to execute her plan. Calista executes her plan: Giving the Goblin the Lemon Sours and retrieve the witches' wands and brooms. After they get out and learn the Goblin only wanted candy, the group decides to give Trick or Treating one more try. With the Goblin's help, they get more candy from Mr P. Afterwards, the witches reconcile with Calista and tell her that she made this the best Halloween ever. They also tell her they are friends and can join them for Trick or Treating next year."

      "Carol of the Arrow": " At Enchancia Castle, the Royal Family is going over reports of Carol of the Arrow and her Merry Band of Helping Hands' good deeds. Sofia is shown to be a huge fan of Carol and voices her dream to be part of her Merry Band. They soon set out to go grape picking in order to test Gwen's grape juice making invention, with Minimus coming along at Sofia's request. While picking grapes, Sofia notices some horses have gotten loose but Carol and the Helping Hands round them up. Sofia goes up to say hello but then hears Carol voice her dislike for the Royal Family because of an incident. So, after concealing Minimus' wings, Sofia takes off her tiara and hides her Amulet before introducing herself. Carol invites Sofia to come with her and tells her that if she can do one good deed by the end of the day, she can be one of her Helping Hands, which makes her second in command Jane jealous. Carol teaches Sofia that there are many ways to help people. Sofia comes up with great plans to help people but the jealous Jane sabotages her every time. Baileywick comes by but Sofia gives him her grape basket and sends him away before anyone can see him. Sofia hears someone calling for help and goes to look. Sofia finds a baby racoon in trouble and goes to get Carol, unaware that Jane had followed her. When Jane's attempt fails, Sofia ties the rope to Minimus' collar and tries to get him to pull the log the baby raccoon's on to shore, but once again, Jane sabotages her, this time in a way that exposes Minimus as a flying horse. Jane pulls out Sofia's amulet and scornfully exposes her as Princess Sofia, to everyone's shock. Sofia admits that Jane is right and tells Carol and the Hands that she wanted to be a Hand but was scared they wouldn't let her in if they knew she was a Princess because of what Carol said earlier, which is why she hid her Royal status. She apologizes to everyone and flies back to the grape orchard on Minimus, heartbroken. Sofia arrives back at the orchard where her family has finished making grape juice and sits sadly down on a log. After Sofia refuses an offer for the juice, Miranda instantly realizes that Sofia's upset and asks what's wrong. At first, Sofia tries to deny it but Miranda takes out her tiara, which Baileywick found in her basket, and asks why she took it off. Sofia tells her mother what Carol said and what she did because of that. Miranda tells her daughter she should always be proud of who she is no matter what anyone else thinks and she should never want to be with people that she can't be herself around, especially since she's such a kind and helpful person. Just then, Carol shows up and asks if she can speak to Sofia. Miranda greets Carol with unconcealed coldness for hurting Sofia's feelings, which she apologizes for and asks Sofia to come back and retry the test, when they hear Jane screaming for help. The pair come back just in time to find Jane in trouble and rescue her. Afterwards, Jane apologizes to Sofia for her acts of sabotage and admits her jealousy. Sofia has passed the test and is now in the band."

      "Through the Looking Back Glass": " At Enchancia Castle, Cedric is waiting outside in the courtyard. Sofia comes up to him and asks for his help with her homework: Using a spell to shrink a watermelon to the size of a grape. When she notices that he is distracted, she asks him if he is okay, to which he tells her he is not: His sister is coming to the Castle to stay for a long while. Cordelia and Calista arrive in their coach. Calista greets her uncle with affection but his sister greets him with scorn. Calista explains that the reason they are staying at Enchancia Castle so long is because their castle is being renovated and her mother and uncle grew up in Enchancia Castle back when their father was the Royal Sorcerer and King Roland I was the King of Enchancia. Cedric offers to bring the bags in but Cordelia wants to do it herself. This causes a magical fight between the two. They arrive in what will be Calista's bedroom and Cordelia uses her magic to get it ready for her daughter before leaving to get ready for dinner. Once she is gone, Cedric tells Sofia and his niece that he fears Cordelia is going to make her stay in the castle a nightmare for him since she does not think he can cast even the simplest spell before he leaves as well. Calista and Sofia are sympathetic with him and decide to tell Cordelia all the great things Cedric has done. However, when they get there, they discover that Cordelia's \"hair\" is really just a wig that she wears to hide a hideous green hairdo. This discovery shocks the pair to the point where they hastily leave. They run into King Roland and tell him what they saw. Roland takes the girls aside and shows them a picture of Cedric and Cordelia when they were younger. Sofia notes they were so close back then and could be again to which Roland tells her that is impossible after the incident at Cordelia's Sorceress Ball. Before he can explain, Baileywick comes over and tells him he is needed in the Throne Room to deal with the Elf Situation again. Calista tells her they can find out what happened with her Looking Back Glass, a magic mirror they can use to see into the past. Using the mirror, Sofia and Calista see the day of Cordelia's Sorceress Ball and see Roland, Tilly, Cedric, and Cordelia when they were kids. Cordelia is fussing over being fabulous for her Ball and Cedric is applying potion after potion to get her ready. When they are done, Cedric offers to cast a spell to make her an entrance. When Cordelia tells him he is too young to cast such a spell, he successfully casts it with a purple serum. However, when he uses the spell with a now white serum he ends up ruining Cordelia's hair. Cedric tries to fix it but he only turns it green. Cordelia's Ball is ruined and everyone blames Cedric. When they return to the present, Cedric, who saw everything, tells Sofia that this incident is why nobody, but his mother and Calista, respected or believed in him until she came along. They then head to his workshop to help Sofia with her homework. However, when they get there, they find Cordelia rearranging all his supplies. After making her stop, Cedric tries to help Sofia with her homework but thanks to Cordelia's rearrangements he has a hard time finding his supplies. This eventually leads to another fight between them that results in the spell going wrong in a way that causes the Castle to shrink. Cedric and Cordelia keep fighting, during which a stray comment makes Sofia and Calista decide to use the Looking Back Glass again. Using the mirror, Sofia and Calista discover that the reason the serum turned white is because Cordelia knocked her hair potion into it by mistake. Upon returning to the present, Sofia and Calista use the Looking Back Glass to show Cordelia what happened to her hair was really her fault. This makes Cedric and Cordelia stop fighting and Cedric returns the Castle to normal. Roland comes in demanding an explanation and Cordelia tells him it was her fault and Cedric fixed everything. Cedric fixes his sister's beautiful hair and takes Sofia outside to help her with her homework as thanks."

      "Pirated Away": " Amber is setting up her telescope so she can watch the Minotaur Meteor Shower, a meteor shower that occurs once a year that Amber is looking forward to seeing. However, when she looks through her telescope, she finds numerous clouds in the sky that will prevent her from seeing the Shower. Sofia suggests that they go sailing together and go somewhere that has clear skies. Amber agrees and, after looking through her telescope, picks the Cloudless Sea as the place to sail to. Sofia agrees and suggest they ask their mother. Amber irritably asks if their mother's permission is really necessary (as she feels like Miranda denies her permission more often than she grants it). Sofia says yes and that she is sure their mother will say yes. However, when they meet up with her, Miranda tells them \"No\" which Sofia is surprised by. Amber, on the other hand, is not surprised. Sofia slides down the stair railing after Miranda. Upon catching up to her, Sofia halts her sliding and tells her mother Amber really wants to see the Shower. Miranda still says no because she cannot let her two daughters go on a sailing trip by themselves much less at night to boot. Sofia assures her that she and Amber are older and have been on a ton of adventures. Miranda still says no and tells her that they are not as grown up as they think. Sofia sadly goes back upstairs lamenting that Amber is going to be so disappointed. In Amber's room, Amber rants how their mother is always telling her what to do and treats them like children. Sofia tells Amber they are children and that their mother is just trying to protect them. Amber claims that she's old enough to do things without constant mothering, especially from someone who's not even her real mother only to be reminded by Sofia that Miranda is her real mother. Miranda comes in and tells them she will take them sailing with her to see the Shower and the three of them set sail for the Cloudless Sea. On a Royal Ship, the trio spot the Cloudless Sea, to Amber's joy. Suddenly, Miranda spots a ship stuck on a reef and goes to help them. Amber protests this, but Sofia reminds her that helping a ship in need is the number one rule of the sea. They tow the ship off the reef but because the captain cannot understand sailor jargen the ship crashes into theirs causing it to sink. The trio climb on board the ship they helped and meet Captain Quivers and his crew, a band of inept pirates. Miranda asks Captain Quivers if they can take her and her daughters back to Enchancia and Quivers says after he and his crew get their treasure, which they have been looking for for fifteen years. However, Captain Quivers and his crew prove to be inept sailors who do not even know how to sail. Amber states they are the worst sailors she has ever seen. Miranda notes they can use this to get home. Miranda offers to help them find their treasure and asks what it is. Captain Quivers tells her they are looking for the Golden Maiden of the Seventeen Seas. Amber is against this, but Sofia assures her their mother knows what she is doing. Sofia asks Captain Quivers who the Golden Maiden is, to which he tells her the Golden Maiden is a magical object that takes a ship wherever it's captain wants to go. They are seeking it so they will not get lost again. The directions to it are in an ancient shanty, which they sing in a way that Miranda and the girls cannot make heads or tails of. Amber feels there is no way to find the Golden Maid and suggests that they escape in the lifeboat while the pirates are not looking. Miranda dismisses that on the grounds it does not look safe and decides they should work out the song. Sofia deduces that Captain Quivers mixed up the words and that the \"Snores of Argyle\" are really the shores of Shark Isle. Miranda points Shark Isle out to the pirates and tells them to sail left. Unfortunately, Amber gets them in trouble when she decides to escape in the lifeboat on her own anyway. Her escape is ruined when her mother's warning about it not being safe proves true when the deck of the rowboat breaks, with water bursting out, causing the rowboat to sink. Miranda throws her a lifeline and pulls Amber back aboard. Feeling betrayed, the pirates make the trio swab the deck. Suddenly, they get attacked by the swordfish who live in the Sea of Swimming Swords, which is what the Sea of Lemming Hordes is, proving that Sofia is right about Captain Quiver getting the words wrong. Sofia steers the ship while Miranda protects the sails. Once the ship is safe, Sofia reveals that the \"Coating Floobs\" are really floating cubes, which are icebergs. Miranda deduces that their next destination is the Icy Sea. With his trust in them restored, Captain Quivers lets Sofia steer the ship and Miranda navigates. Miranda heads up to the Crow's Nest with Amber to tell Sofia how to get past the icebergs. On the way to the Icy Sea, Amber vents her frustrations to her mother and Miranda tells her she was just thinking of her safety, which is what moms do. Sofia calls out that they have arrived in the Icy Sea and Miranda tells her which way to turn. During the trek through the icebergs, Amber falls overboard and on one of the icebergs, with Miranda going after her. Amber finally sees her wrongdoings and apologizes, confessing she can be so selfish. Miranda, in turn, realizes her kids are growing up fast, knowing the adventures they go on. Quivers is mad and is about to abandon them, but Sofia convinces him to let her turn the ship around and go back to the iceberg for her mother and sister, knowing that the pirates can’t find the maiden on their own. After they do, they continue their quest. Amber deduces that \"The Weaveing Part of the Loom\" is really the Evening Star of Khaldune and sail toward that. Miranda deduces that Quivers got the rest of the song right as the whirly burly is a cluster of whirlpools. After getting past the whirlpools, they find the spot where the full moon is reflected. They find the Golden Maiden, and Quivers keeps his word and uses it to head for Enchancia. On the way back, they watch the Minotaur Meteor Shower, to Amber's joy."

      "Gone with the Wand": " Cedric is working in his workshop when Sofia comes in. Sofia won a contest at school and the prize she won was an invitation to Merlin's castle. The invitation states that she's allowed to bring two guests and Sofia invites Cedric, to the sorcerer's joy. Cedric has always wanted to meet Merlin due to idolizing him. Suddenly, Cedric's sister Cordelia the Conjuror, and her daughter Calista come in and remind him he's supposed to watch the latter. Calista is revealed to be going through a kleptomaniac phase where she takes things without asking especially anything red. At first, Cedric fears he can't go meet Merlin until Sofia reminds him she can bring two guests. The trio arrive at Merlin's castle Dragon Hold. After going inside, they hear a voice coming from a mirror. The voice is revealed to be Merlin's. Merlin comes out and reveals it's a spell he's working on. Cedric goes gaga over meeting Merlin who conjures up mushrooms. Calista sees a red hat and takes it but Sofia and her Uncle Ceddy insist that she put it back. Merlin then gives the trio a magical tour of his castle. During the tour, Merlin shows them the Dragonclaw Wand, which he used to defeat his arch-enemy, the evil enchantress Morgana. The trio thank Merlin for the tour and leave. Sofia and Cedric both voice how happy they are until Calista reveals she took the Dragonclaw Wand, to their horror. Things get worse when Morgana appears and takes the wand from Calista. Fortunately, she can't use it because Merlin put a protection charm on it that makes it so that only he can use it. Cedric tries to get the wand back with a spell but Morgana reflects his spell back at him and escapes. After Cedric is freed by his niece, the trio head to Morgana's castle which is guarded by imps. After learning they are always hungry, Sofia comes up with the idea to use food to distract the imps and Calista conjures up cookies. The cookies distract the imps and the trio sneaks in the castle and finds it full of mirrors. Unfortunately, Calista sees a ruby and takes it, awakening a centaur who captures Cedric. Sofia and Calista head back to Merlin's castle where the latter, at Sofia's urging, apologizes to Merlin. They sneak back into Morgana's castle using Merlin's mirror trick. They free Cedric and gets the Dragonclaw Wand back. Merlin defeats Morgana and traps her in the mirror. Calista is given the red hat she wanted earlier and promises to ask for things she wants from now on."

      "The Secret Library": " At Enchancia Castle, Sofia is having a flying derby race with her friends when her Aunt Tilly suddenly arrives and pays a visit. Upon arriving at the castle, Aunt Tilly asks Sofia how she's doing with the book she gave her. Sofia tells her she is still at Chapter Twelve and comments how she never knew there were so many Kings and Queens in Enchancia. Tilly tells her niece that there is a lot of history within the walls of Enchancia Castle and reminds her to read Chapter Seventeen, which is her favorite. Sometime later, Sofia reaches Chapter Seventeen of the book and finds a little blue book called Behind the Walls, a book about secret passages in the castle, inside it. Clover comes in and, upon being told by Sofia what she is reading, shows her the passageway he uses to get inside the castle. When Sofia goes up to take a look, her Amulet suddenly glows sapphire blue. Sofia enters the passageway using her shrinking ability. After returning to normal size, Sofia goes down the tunnel using her Amulet as a guide. Her Amulet's light guides her to a crystalline boat which she gets on. The magical boat takes Sofia through a tunnel where she passes settings referencing the worlds of Disney Princesses. At the tunnel's end, the boat drops Sofia off at another staircase that leads to a gate. When Sofia notices that the keyhole looks like her book, she realizes Behind the Walls is the key and uses the blue book to open the gate and goes inside. Sofia enters a room stocked to the brim with shelves of books. A floating elevator drops from the ceiling and Sofia gets on it. The elevator takes her all the way to the top where she sees her castle in the distance. A wowed Sofia wonders where she is. Tilly appears and tells her she is in the Secret Library, a library where most of the books do not have endings. Tilly explains how when she was a young Princess she wore the Amulet of Avalor and how the Amulet led her to the Library thirty years before. Tilly also tells her that she is the Secret Library's Storykeeper, the person whose job it is to go out and give each story in the Library a happy ending, and how she has chosen Sofia to be the new Storykeeper because the Amulet chose her and she passed all her secret tests. The Library's books begin to glow and a book floats off a shelf and lands into Sofia hands. The book is called The Tale of Wildwing Valley, which is the first story Sofia has to finish. It tells the story about Minimus' brother, Mazzimo, who wanted to live free as a wild horse in Wildwing Valley, a magically hidden land where enchanted creatures roam free. Unfortunately, Mazzimo was captured by the Knights of Borrea and taken to Borrea Castle where he has been held against his will by Prince Roderick ever since. Tilly tells Sofia that to give this story a happy ending she has to save Mazzimo and grant his wish to live in Wildwing Valley. Sofia is not sure she can do it on her own so Tilly offers to come along and help out just this once. After changing into her Storykeeper outfit, Sofia heads to the stables to get Minimus and flies off for Borrea with Tilly. When they arrive at Borrea Castle, Sofia and Tilly split up to find Mazzimo. Sofia and Minimus sneak into the stable to find the latter's brother. Upon finding him, Minimus yells at Mazzimo for taking off and leaving their family for no reason to which his older brother states that he had a reason. Minimus continues to vent, ranting how they came to save him and that this is the nicest stable ever. Prince Roderick's other horses, Tempest and Elegra, tell Minimus that that is what they keep telling Mazzimo but he does not listen even though they have heated stalls. Annoyed, Mimimus tells them the only way to heat his stall is to have a dragon set it on fire. Mazzimo tells them that while Borrea Castle's Royal Stables is nice \"a cozy cage is still a cage,\" and he'd rather be free. Sofia breaks it up and starts trying to get him out as Tilly arrives. Suddenly, Prince Roderick appears with his stable master Gavin. After introductions are made, Sofia tells the Prince of Borrea that Mazzimo wants to be free but Roderick refuses to listen and orders Gavin to open the stall so he can take him for a spin. As soon as the stall is open, Sofia tells Mazzimo to fly for it and she and Tilly trip up Roderick and Gavin so they and Mazzimo can get away. Not willing to lose such a fine horse as \"Thundercloud\", Roderick and Gavin give chase but Aunt Tilly loses them with one of the devices in her bag. However, Minimus is still angry and too busy arguing with Mazzimo that he becomes too distracted to pay attention to where he's going. This causes him to almost crash into a tree in a way that makes Sofia fall off him. Tilly catches Sofia in a way that makes them lose her bag. The two brothers are so worried about Sofia that they do not notice that Roderick and Gavin have caught up enabling them to capture the two horses. Roderick orders that they land so the two horses can be secured for the ride back to his castle. Sofia thinks they need Aunt Tilly's bag since Roderick has a sword and all they have is an umbrella, despite her aunt's assurance that the umbrella can be mightier than the sword. They both land and look for it. During the search, Sofia gives into despair and her doubts about whether she has what it takes to be the Storykeeper resurfaces. Her Amulet glows and an arrow is shot in her direction. The shooter is revealed to be Princess Merida. Sofia tells Merida about how she is looking for Tilly's bag but Merida tells her she does not need it and what she does need is the belief that she can save the day herself. Sofia continues to voice her doubts through a lament but Merida tells her that if she believes in herself and what she can do she can do anything. After shooting an arrow successfully, Sofia resolves to save the day on her own and takes off on Athena while Tilly and Merida watch proudly. Meanwhile, Roderick and the others have landed and Minimus and Mazzimo have been secured. Minimus hates how he has been tied up and Mazzimo tells him that is how he feels every day he spends in a horse stall and why he left home despite loving his family and the two brothers reconcile. They take off for Borrea Castle. Suddenly, Sofia arrives on Athena. After sending her back for Tilly, Sofia hops on to Minimus and frees him. Gavin alerts Roderick who tells Sofia to fly along home. Sofia unseats him using Tilly's umbrella. Gavin goes after his master while Sofia frees Mazzimo. Upon doing so, they fly away with Tempest and Elegra following suit due to having enough of Roderick, leaving him and Gavin stranded. After Tilly arrives with her bag, they set off for Wildwing Valley, where they are welcomed by Marshand. Mazzimo and Minimus part on good terms and Minimus, Sofia, Athena, and Tilly head back to Enchancia. Upon arriving back in the Secret Library, Tilly congratulates Sofia for finishing her first story. When Sofia asks what is next, Tilly tells her to have a seat and find out."

      "Princess Butterfly": " The princes and princesses are excited for the All Hallows Eve Costume Ball, especially Princess Amber, who's determined to win the Costume Contest for the third year in a row. But the Fairies have changed the rules to the contest: The princes and princesses have to make their own costumes by themselves. Princess Sofia is excited to get started, but the other princesses are dismayed, especially Amber, who's never done any sewing in her life. At home, Amber tries to make her costume, but she can't even get the thread into the needle. Sofia comes and offers to show her big sister how to sew her costume as she threads the needle. Amber declines Sofia's offer and tries to sew her costume, but she winds up pricking her finger. Just as Amber is about to give up, she hears Queen Miranda compliment Sofia on her costume. Amber goes to Sofia's bedroom and sees that Sofia has made a beautiful silver swan costume. Knowing that Sofia is sure to win the costume contest this year, Amber goes to Cedric for a spell that would give her a magnificent costume. At first, Cedric disapproves the idea of using magic to win the costume contest, but he gives her a spell to give her a great costume, but it turns out to be a plot to get Sofia's amulet. At the costume ball, Sofia gains a lot of attention when everybody sees her beautiful swan costume. Everybody is sure that she will win the contest. Amber uses her spell to turn her gown into a realistic butterfly costume, and she wins the costume contest. But there's one big problem: when she gets home, she can't remove the costume as it turns out that Amber is an actual human butterfly! She goes to Cedric to help undo the spell, and Cedric decides to use a potion to undo it. But he says he needs Sofia's amulet for the potion to be complete. Amber doesn't want to take Sofia's amulet, and she decides to go to the fairies instead. But Cedric points out that if she goes to the fairies, she'd have to tell them that she cheated and used magic to make her costume. Not wanting to face the music or give up her new trophy, Amber decides that she has to get Sofia's amulet. The next day, Amber decides to trick Sofia into taking off her amulet. She decides it would be fun to \"dress up for school\". She decides to wear her butterfly costume, and she offers to let her little sister wear her pixie costume from last year. Amber says that Sofia would have to take the amulet off to put the costume on. But as she tries to remove the amulet, James reminds his sisters that it's time to leave for school which means that Sofia doesn't have time to change clothes. At school, everybody is wondering why Amber is wearing her \"costume\" to school, and Amber claims that she loves All Hallows Eve so much that she's decided to celebrate longer. During gym class, Amber asks Sofia to demonstrate going upside-down on the uneven bars. As Sofia is on the bars, Amber tries to remove her amulet but Sofia gets down quickly now suspicious that Amber's up to something. Outside, Amber throws her drink at Sofia's gown and tries to take the amulet but Sofia now knows that her big sister is definitely up to something since she never trips and never spills anything. Amber's cover is blown when her butterfly wings send her flying, and she winds up telling Sofia that she used magic to make her costume and that \"the spell went wrong\", so she needs the amulet to undo the spell. Sofia decides to give Amber her amulet to get back to normal, but Amber refuses to take the amulet, because she now knows it was wrong to cheat and it's not fair for Sofia to give up something she loves because Amber did something bad. However, Wormwood follows and does take the Amulet. Amber and Sofia chase him around the school. Amber uses her wings to fly and Sofia gets on Minimus with the whole school seeing this. When the sisters catch Sofia's amulet, Sofia decides it would be good to take it to Cedric but Amber has a better idea. Amber confesses that she used magic to make her costume instead of making it herself because she was jealous of Sofia when she saw her swan costume. But now Amber knows that she shouldn't have been jealous of her little sister and that she should appreciate her. The fairies are very disappointed upon hearing this and Amber has to return the trophy, likely giving it to whoever would have gotten second place, which is, presumably Sofia. However, the fairies undo the spell. Sofia and Amber agree to work on the costumes together and walk out laughing about it."

      "Royal Vacation": " It is night time at the castle of Enchancia and Miranda is in the Family Room getting it ready for Game Night. Sofia arrives late since she was practicing Flying Derby and lost track of time. Miranda informs her that her father and siblings have not shown up either. While Miranda goes to get Roland, Sofia goes to get Amber and James. Sofia finds Amber redesigning her closet so she can look at the stars while she is changing clothes and she promises to show up. Sofia also finds James playing with his toy soldiers on \"an exciting and daring quest to save King Ashford\" and also promises to show up. Miranda finds Roland with the Royal Builder designing a castle for the elves and also promises to show up. However, the trio never show up at all. Miranda asks Sofia when it was the last time their family spent some quality time together but Sofia cannot even remember when that was. Miranda decides to book a vacation to the Royal Elephant Rain Forests so they can spend some quality time together. On the day of the trip, Baileywick packs their luggage in the Cloud Coaster, a new automobile Roland has been dying to take for a spin. They take off to the Royal Elephant Park to spend five days there. Along the way, their luggage falls out. When they arrive, Roland and the twins' enthusiasm instantly vanishes: The \"lodge\" is just an old wooden hut that's so rotted with decay it looks like it will fall down any second, the \"cruise boat\" is just an old wooden raft, and Fabulous Freddy, their guide to see the Flying Elephants, is sick in bed. Amber is horrified when she discovers their luggage is gone. Miranda and Sofia decide to just take their family on the tour to see the Flying Elephants themselves on the raft. The raft ride is mostly boring for the twins. It takes a negative turn when they run into some Spider Monkeys who pelt them with fruit. Roland and the twins want to go back to the lodge but Sofia insists that they continue since she wants to see the Flying Elephants.

      "When You Wish Upon a Well": " James and Sofia are having a race, but Sofia is not fast enough. Roland offers to help her with the Royal Obstacle Course, and she accepts. Then, Miranda arrives holding a cat, who makes Roland sneeze because he is allergic to cats. Amber wants to play Blazing Badminton with Roland, but he is busy helping Sofia. Amber feels jealous of Sofia, and tells James that Roland has been spending all his time with her, but James states that is not true because Roland spends a lot of time with him too. In order to get her father to spend more time with her, Amber arranges a tea party for just herself and Roland, but the cat Miranda found is there, causing Roland to start sneezing again and run off. Amber decides to have the Royal Chef make a blackberry pie for her father. In the garden, while looking for blackberries, Amber stumbles upon an old Wishing Well, which grants each user three wishes. Amber uses her first wish to have a new tiara, which appears on her head. Then she makes a bad choice for her next wish; she wishes Roland was allergic to Sofia, so he would stay away from her and spend time with Amber. However, this wish backfires: Roland is still training Sofia when Amber's second wish comes true...and Sofia turns into a purple cat. At first, she does not realize it, even as Roland sneezes and does not see her. Then, Sofia looks at her reflection in water, realizes why Roland is sneezing, and runs to Clover. They head over to Cedric, and try to explain what happened. Unfortunately, Cedric cannot understand animal, and does not recognize Sofia. Wormwood, however, does, and tries to take her Amulet. Sofia and Clover are thrown out of Cedric's quarters, and go looking for Miranda with Wormwood in pursuit. Miranda asks Amber and Roland, who are playing Blazing Badminton, if they have seen the white cat, and Roland states he has seen them both. Miranda is surprised to hear that there are two cats. Roland starts sneezing because Sofia is right behind him. Miranda does not recognize Sofia, and remarks that she is the most darling shade of purple, much to her confusion. Roland tells Miranda and Amber that \"It was like Sofia vanished when that cat showed up.\" Amber realizes that when she wished Roland was allergic to Sofia, she turned her into a purple cat. She gets her sister away from their father, and takes her to the well to change her little sister back. But she ends up turning Sofia pink with her last wish. Because Amber does not have any wishes left, she cannot fix the mess she made, and the Wishing Well would not make any exceptions. Just when the sisters think it cannot get any worse, Sofia gets chased around the race course by Rex and Wormwood. While James tries to catch Rex, Amber tries to save her sister, but fails. Knowing she cannot wish Sofia back to normal, Amber goes to Roland for help. Amber admits that she turned Sofia into a cat by wishing upon the wishing well that she would make Roland sneeze, much to Roland's horror. Meanwhile, Rex and Wormwood chase Sofia around the race course until James catches Rex, and Roland catches Sofia. Roland and the two princesses go back to the wishing well. Roland strictly wishes for Sofia to be her normal beautiful human self again. When Sofia goes back to normal, the wishing well reveals that Roland now has one wish remaining. That means he already made a wish before, and that first wish did not go too well. Roland does not tell his daughters what happened, and wants to be happy Sofia is back in her human form. Amber apologizes to Sofia for turning her into a cat, and Roland apologizes to Amber for making her feel left out. Once Sofia wins the race with her new-found talents of maneuvering, Roland starts sneezing again, much to Amber's horror. It turns out that it is the white cat making him sneeze. Sofia, James, and Miranda go off to the village to find a new owner for the cat, and Amber and Roland go off together to play. But then Clover finds the well and wishes for a lifetime supply of radishes."

      "The Secret Library Olaf and the Tale of Miss Nettle": " Sofia arrives in the Secret Library, having been summoned there by her amulet. The Library selects the story called The Tale of Miss Nettle, to Sofia's horror. Sofia wonders what Miss Nettle is up to now. She gets her answer when the book goes inside the pendulum and the Library Narrator tells her the story. For many years, there were no flowers in Freezenburg until the King sent the Royal Gardener on a quest to find a flower strong enough to grow in Freezenburg's frigid climate. The Gardener returned with such a flower: The Snowdrop. The King and his subjects loved the Snowdrop so much that they had it planted all over the Kingdom and every year they hold the Winter Flower Festival in honor of the flower. However, the Winter Flower Festival is under threat by Miss Nettle, who is stealing all the Snowdrops. If she succeeds, not only will the Winter Flower Festival be ruined but the Kingdom of Freezenburg will never have flowers again. Hearing this, Sofia resolves to stop Miss Nettle and give this story a happy ending. Sofia arrives in Freezenburg in a crystalline sleigh pulled by Minimus and finds Miss Nettle taking Snowdrops in a forest. Sofia enlists the forest animals to help her stop Miss Nettle. The animals and Sofia swoop in with the latter grabbing the bag of stolen Snowdrops. Miss Nettle is not pleased to see her \"least favorite meddling Princess\" and asks Sofia why she always gets in her way. Sofia retorts that she causes so many problems, and Miss Nettle tells her she is merely taking back what is hers. Sofia snaps that the flowers belong to the People of Freezenburg, to which Miss Nettle bites back that the Snowdrops belong to her. Miss Nettle sprays Sofia with Crazy Crystals and flies away with the bag of stolen Snowdrops. Sofia finds that she can't understand the animals anymore and, remembering what they did to Cedric's wand during her last run in with Miss Nettle, realizes that the Crazy Crystals have corrupted the magic of her amulet. Suddenly, Sofia's amulet starts to glow and Sofia recognizes it as a summoning. Sofia looks around for a Princess but only finds a talking snowman who scares her to the point where she kicks his head off. After Sofia helps him get his head back on his shoulders, the snowman introduces himself as Olaf. Sofia introduces herself and Minimus, who Olaf calls a purple reindeer with wings and no antlers to the pony's chagrin. When Olaf asks her what she's looking for, Sofia tells him she's looking for a Princess. However, upon hearing about how he was with Anna in Arendelle, Sofia realizes that the amulet summoned Olaf instead of a Princess and explains that her amulet usually summons a Princess to give her advice. Olaf tells her that he can give her advice but his \"advice\" is just \"Do not get too close to fire.\" which Sofia, of course, does not find even the least bit helpful. Sofia realizes that she now has to stop Miss Nettle and fix her amulet so Olaf can go home. Olaf tells her that he and \"the purple antleerless reindeer\" will help her out. Together, they take off to find Miss Nettle. During the sleigh ride, Olaf's nose falls off and he dives after it. He lands on a Snowdrop and rolls into a Freezenburgian village. When Sofia lands in the village, she finds a bunch of snowmen built by the village kids and only finds Olaf after he reveals himself. Sofia confides in Olaf her belief that she can't stop Miss Nettle without her powers. Olaf tells her how Elsa struggled with her Ice magic and finally learned to control it because Anna helped her do so by never giving up and having a big heart, which he states is better than any magic. Princess Hildegard appears and is surprised to find Sofia and especially Olaf. Hildegard tells Sofia that her father is cancelling the Winter Flower Festival because the only Snowdrops left are at Freezenburg Castle. Sofia tells Hildegard that Miss Nettle is the one taking the Snowdrops and takes off to Freezenburg Castle. When they arrive at Freezenburg Castle, they find that Miss Nettle is already there and already taking the flowers. Olaf dives out of the sleigh to stop her. He lands on her in a way that enables Sofia to land safely. Sofia informs Miss Nettle how much the People of Freezenburg love the Snowdrop and Miss Nettle informs Sofia that she created the Snowdrop and that the Royal Gardener of Freezenburg stole it from her. Sympathetic, Sofia urges Miss Nettle to leave some flowers but Miss Nettle refuses and traps Sofia in vines. After a pep talk with Olaf, Sofia realizes that she needs to make a happy ending for everyone including Miss Nettle. After Olaf frees her from the vines, Sofia meets up with Hildegard and her father King Henrik and tells them Miss Nettle's reason for taking the Snowdrops. After a Snowdrop is found on Olaf's butt, Sofia comes up with a plan to bring Miss Nettle and the Snowdrops back and flies off to execute it. When Sofia finds Miss Nettle, she uses the last Snowdrop to bring Miss Nettle back to Freezenburg Castle. Once there, King Henrik thanks Miss Nettle for making the Snowdrop and asks her if they can be renamed Nettledrops in her honor. Miss Nettle agrees and thanks Sofia by undoing the effects of the Crazy Crystals, restoring Sofia's powers. Sofia thanks Olaf for everything and gives him a hug. Olaf heads back to Arendelle and Sofia heads back to the Secret Library, where she put a Nettledrop in the story she just finished."

      "The Enchanted Feast": " Cedric is preparing for the Enchanted Feast, a grand dinner for all of the rulers in the Tri-Kingdom Area, when Sofia comes in. Cedric shows Sofia the spell he's going to do for the Feast, Morpho Mirrors, to Sofia's delight. Unbeknownst to Sofia, she is being watched by Miss Nettle and her pet enchanted rose, Rosey. Miss Nettle had recognized Sofia's amulet the last time she saw the young princess and has long since identified it as the Amulet of Avalor and now she wants it. Rosey reminds her that Princess Sofia knows what she looks like and that she's up to no good and therefore she won't just hand over her amulet. So Miss Nettle disguises herself as Sasha the Sorceress for Plan A: gain Sofia's trust and then trick her into handing over the amulet. Sasha manages to charm everyone except Sofia, who senses something familiar about her that gives her the heebie jeebies. Sasha offers Sofia an Egyptian style ruby necklace and offers to help take off her old one so she can put on her new one but Sofia tells her she promised her father she would never take off her amulet. Amber asks for the ruby necklace and Sofia gives it to her and tells Sasha she'll see her at the feast. Rosey blames Plan A's failure on Amber but Sasha states the real reason Plan A failed is because Sofia can't be tricked because she's too smart. So they come up with Plan B: during the feast have Rosey sprout out in a way that will tie up Sofia and trap everyone inside and then threaten to hex everyone unless Sofia hands over the amulet. To make sure Cedric doesn't get in the way, Sasha hexes his wand so he can't use his spells. Sofia knows there's something not right about Sasha but no one listens to her. During the feast, all of Cedric's spells go wrong and he is rudely dismissed by both Roland and Amber. Sofia goes after him to comfort him foiling Plan B. This makes Sasha and Rosey implement Plan C: Trap everyone inside and then take care of Sofia. Rosey sprouts vines and traps everyone inside. When Roland notices that Sasha is missing, he and Baileywick check the doors and find that they are stuck. Everyone finally realizes that Sofia was right all along but can't figure out why she locked them in due to the fact that nobody knows she's after Sofia's amulet. Worried that Sasha may harm Sofia, Roland orders the guards to cut the vines which they do, to no avail. Once outside, Sofia tells Clover what happened and about her bad feeling about Sasha. Suddenly, Sofia's amulet begins to glow summoning Snow White. Sofia asks Snow White why the amulet summoned her since there's nothing wrong but Snow White can tell that Sofia doesn't really believe that and proceeds to tell the young princess about the time an old woman came to her and offered an apple and how the old woman turned out to be Snow White's wicked stepmother, The Evil Queen, in disguise and that the apple turned out to be poisoned. Snow White then tells Sofia that people aren't always what they seem which is why she has to be careful around strangers especially ones she just met and when she gets a bad feeling about someone she should trust that feeling no matter what anyone else says. She also tells Sofia that if she knows something is wrong and nobody will listen, it becomes up to her to do something about it before it's too late. After she vanishes, Sofia goes to warn her parents only to meet Sasha who has trapped everyone inside the dining room and who then reveals herself to have been Miss Nettle all along. Miss Nettle has Rosey seal up the whole castle. Realizing that she's trapped, Sofia goes to Cedric and tells him everything. Cedric tries to stop Miss Nettle but fails because he's still using a hexed wand. Sofia, with help from Clover and Wormwood, gets Cedric a spare wand and together they finally stop Miss Nettle again with Cedric's Morpho Mirrors but she escapes. After Cedric frees everyone, Roland and Miranda are glad Sofia is not hurt and the feast resumes with his display of Morpho Mirrors."

      "The Mystic Isles A Very Mystic Wassalia": " On the Mystic Isles, the Protectors are having their last meeting of the year at their castle. Garish and Galial notice that Sofia is bothered by something. Sofia tells them she is just nervous about giving Chrysta the Wassalia gift she made her as she is normally difficult. The pair assure her that Chrysta will like it. Chrysta comes in, in a surprisingly good mood as Wassalia is her favorite holiday of the year. Chrysta, Garish and Galial explain to Sofia how they celebrate on the Mystic Isles: On the Isles of Centaurs they have a big Wassalia race, on the Isle of Fauns they play music together under the moon, and on the Isle of Giants they bake cookies. Sofia is about to give Chrysta her gift when Orion suddenly says there is trouble on one of the Isles. Chrysta volunteers for the job. Sofia asks if she has got holiday plans to which Chrysta says she does. She says she and her family squeeze into her little cottage for a Fairy Feast, but asserts that it is hours away so she has time. Garish adds that Chrysta always volunteers for last minute jobs on Wassalia. Galial tells Sofia that Chrysta never lets them do them. Hearing them, Sofia volunteers for the job and Chrysta surprisingly says yes. Sofia summons Skye, and together they head for the Isle of Rompkins. On the way to the Isle of Rompkins, Skye notes that Chrysta is in a good mood, and Sofia gives him her gift: Molasses and peppermint. Skye tells Sofia that on the Isle of Unicorns they celebrate Wassalia by displaying ice sculptures on Starmane Hill. The group runs into an elf pulling a sleigh. Skye informs Sofia that the elf is Elfalfa, who delivers gifts to all the inhabitants of the Mystic Isles every Wassalia. Chrysta asks Elfalfa if he is going to need her help again this year which he refutes by informing her that he has a helper this year: His daughter Elfabetty, who is digging through the gifts for holiday treats. The group arrives on the Isle of Rompkins and learn that their Wassalia Tree has been stolen. While Chrysta helps herself to the Slog Nog Harrumph and the other Rompkins made, Sofia sees the Rompkins' tree flying away. The group chases the tree to the spot where Harrumph got it in the first place. While Chrysta helps herself to an Upside-Down Holiday Cake, Sofia sees the ornaments on the tree turn into some creatures and back before Chrysta notices. Deciding to investigate further, Sofia shrinks herself down to stand on the tree branch, to the shock of Chrysta who did not know Sofia had the ability to shrink herself. Sofia climbs up the tree and introduces herself to the creatures disguised as ornaments which she learns are called Hoodwinks. Hidey, the lead Hoodwink, tells Sofia that the tree is their home. They think the Rompkins are scary creatures who meant to steal their home so they snuck away with their tree. Sofia advises them to talk it out with them. Sofia informs Harrumph about this. He apologizes, saying they just wanted a Wassalia tree and their‘s is so beautiful. He and the Hoodwinks work out a compromise where the Rompkins use the tree for Wassalia and the Hoodwinks keep their home. Suddenly, Elfalfa and Elfabetty crash in on their sleigh. Elfalfa tells Chrysta he needs her help after all. After hitching Skye up to the sleigh with the bigger stack of gifts, The group takes off to aid in the deliveries. Suddenly, Vega calls and reveals that Elfalfa has lost Elfabetty. The group takes off to help him find her. When they arrive, Sofia discovers that Elfabetty was under the remaining gifts on the sleigh eating candy she found the whole time. Chrysta offers to continue helping Elfalfa only for him to tell her the only gifts left are the ones for Elfabetty. With nothing left to do, Chrysta sadly goes home. Noticing this and discovering she still has not given her gift, Sofia goes after her on Skye. Upon arriving however, Sofia and Skye see that Chrysta's house is nothing like what she said. Upon giving Chrysta her gift, Sofia confronts her on this and she admits that she has no family which is why she fills her Wassaila with Protector duties. Her way of celebrating is by joining everyone else while they celebrate. Sofia offers to bring her to Enchancia to spend Wassalia with her family, but Chrysta refuses, thinking she just feels bad for her. Little does she know that Sofia cares because of how much she’s done for her. Sofia and Skye have a plan that requires them to go everywhere. Chrysta opens Sofia's gift, which is an ornament with a picture of her and Sofia on it. She gratefully hangs on her tree, which has no other decorations. Sofia comes back with the other inhabitants of the Mystic Isles, who are here to thank her for everything she did for their sake. Chrysta doesn’t have a food in her home, but Orion shows her they brought bread and banana pudding, her favorites and they all celebrate Wassalia together."

      "The Princess Stays in the Picture": " At Royal Prep, the Fairies are teaching the kids about Enchanted Paintings, paintings that comes to life when you enter it and that the magic will only work if you use an Enchanted Paintbrush. The kids are paired and Hildegard becomes Sofia's painting partner. When Flora is explaining how to get inside a painting, Hildegard brags to Sofia that she knows everything about Enchanted Paintings and, because of this, both of them fail to hear the exit spell. Amber, who is paired with James, paints a tea party, while James paints warthogs, after Amber gets inside the painting. The warthogs make a huge mess of everything, leaving the twins in despair. Sofia and Hildegard paint a mermaid cove. Hildegard says the entrance spell but points it at a painting in the hallway of Enchanted Paintings instead. Since they do not know the exit spell, Sofia and Hildegard are stuck there. Hildegard insists she knows the spell but they do not get out no matter how hard she tries. They meet a kindly old man there, who says he'll give them the exit spell if they get the dog inside a painting in the end of the hallway, as he gets really lonely. He also tells them, to get into another painting, they have to point the paintbrush at the edge of the painting. The girls agree and get into the next painting, which is a flying derby race and Hildegard continues to brag as they head into the next painting, which has a sailboat docked at a pier. Hildegard says she has been sailing since she was three, while Sofia has when she was only four. But Hildegard only gets them caught in a storm and they are thrown off the boat. They get inside the next painting - a Chinese village - just in time. Sofia is furious with Hildegard for getting them thrown off the boat. In the next painting, they come across a sleeping bull. Sofia states they should tiptoe so they do not wake the bull up but Hildegard states that there is no need for that because he is hibernating. Hildegard starts to explain what hibernation is but Sofia tells her that she already knows what it is and that bulls do not hibernate. Hildegard states bulls do hibernate and claims she knows everything about bulls. Sofia, who is starting to lose her patience, reminds her that she did not know the real exit spell or how to sail despite claiming otherwise and states that because of that she doubts that she knows anything about bulls either. Hildegard shouts that she knows everything about bulls which wakes the bull up. The beast grabs Hildegard's paintbrush, but the two manage to get inside the last painting. They get the dog, but the bull comes inside the painting, frightening the dog away. Meanwhile, Amber and James still have no idea on how to calm down the warthogs in their paintings. But when James mentions warthog food, Amber gets an idea. She gets out of the painting, paints warthog food and gets back into the painting. She promises the warthogs can have the food if they behave. Everything goes on well and both James and Amber get the painting they want. Meanwhile, Hildegard insists she knows how to find the dog, and after failing to give a explanation how, Sofia finally loses her patience with her and goes away by herself to find the dog. Hildegard finally admits that she pretends to know everything because she thinks princesses are supposed to know everything. Sofia asks her why she believes that and Hildegard reveals why: when she joined Royal Prep, she didn't have any friends yet. When she went to join her older sister and her friends, they asked her to try their princess twirl. But she didn't know how to twirl like them, so she fell down, and her sister's friends laughed at her. That is why, she acts like she knows everything, only because she wants everyone to like her. Sofia feels bad for Hildegard and tells her, to make friends, she just has to be humble and kind. and they both grow closer to each other. They find the dog, which the bull is torturing. Hildegard bravely faces the bull and knocks him down and even gets back her paintbrush. They start their journey of going back to the first painting and Sofia even teaches Hildegard how to sail. They give the dog to the man and he gives them the exit spell. The two get out of the painting and Flora comes to inspect their paintings. When they go back, Hildegard and Sofia hug, telling each other they are happy to be friends."

      "The Amulet and the Anthem": " Sofia is chosen to be the Enchancian Anthem Singer at the annual Harvest Festival. Before she knows it, she gets interviewed, her portrait painted, and showered with gifts. She soon ends up letting all this paparazzi go to her head to the point where she gloats about it to Ruby and Jade in a way that hurts their feelings and makes them storm off in a huff. Afterwards, Sofia's amulet glows in a dark and ominous way. Suddenly, during rehearsal, Sofia starts croaking like a frog. Clover is convinced that Sofia has been cursed, so she decides to go and see Cedric about it. However, she bumps into Baileywick in a way that leads to him and Amber almost finding out but Clover intervienes with a bullfrog that scares them away. Cedric jumps for joy when Sofia tells him she's cursed. When he explains that her amulet is the cause, Sofia at first is surprised because she thought the amulet just gives her magical powers until Cedric reminds her about the Amulet's rule and explains it's full meaning: When the current bearer of the Amulet of Avalor does a very good deed, it will bless it's bearer with a magical power but if the current bearer does a very bad deed, the amulet will place a curse on the bearer as punishment. Sofia can't recall doing something bad but she knows Cedric is telling the truth because it's the only explanation for why she's cursed. Cedric couldn't care less for what she did and he attempts to persuade her into giving him her amulet so he can take a look at it but Sofia declines due to the promise she made to her father and hopes Cedric has a spell in one of his books. As expected, he tells her he doesn't and makes another request but again Sofia declines. Cedric decides to leave it at that. However it doesn't bother him because he plans to use Sofia's desperation to his advantage. Leaving her with her misery, she'll become desperate enough to give him the amulet. After getting a good night's sleep, Clover proposes that he and Sofia go over what she did in hopes of figuring out why she was suddenly cursed. Sofia goes over everything but is unable to figure out what she did wrong. Just then they overhear Amber boasting to her friends about the time she sang the anthem, which makes Sofia finally realize the reason she's cursed. She remembers gloating about being chosen to sing at the anthem which hurt Jade and Ruby's feelings because at the time they were already feeling bad about not getting chosen to be the singers, which must be the reason the amulet placed a curse on her. Before the festival, Sofia apologizes to Ruby and Jade for her bragging and the three make up. Sofia rushes off for the stage only to run into Cedric who makes another play for the Amulet. Sofia happily tells him that she figured out what happened and broke the curse only to find out she is still croaking which pleases Cedric. Seeing as the festival is going to start soon he agrees to lift the curse if she hands over the amulet. Sofia turns him down once more. Cedric backs off and says he'll wait by the stage but also warns her to hurry as time is running out for her. Sofia is in trouble now, especially since it's almost time for her to sing. Before Sofia knows it, her amulet summons Belle, who tells Sofia that the reason she is still cursed despite her apology is because she still hasn't made things right. She then tells her about the Beast and explains what she has to do in order to break the curse: Since the amulet cursed her for saying things that made her friends feel worse about not being chosen to be the singer, she must do something that will make them feel better. So Sofia offers to let her friends sing the anthem which breaks the curse. Jade and Ruby invite Sofia to sing with them, which she declines, yet Jade and Ruby insist and drag their friend on stage and the trio sing together."

Miranda helps by heading to the attic to find decorations for the ball, and Sofia helps her father out by being his right hand girl and helping him with his list: Selecting the new Court Jester, the elf situation, the knighting ceremony, expansion plans for the Enchanted Animal Park, etc. They finish by dinnertime and meet up with Miranda who shows them an elegant if unusual mirror she found. Overwhelmed by the multitude of things he's had to do, and with the promise of an even busier day tomorrow, Roland remarks wistfully about the easier life that being a village baker must be. Sofia notices the mirror sparkling after he wishes this, but thinks she must be seeing things. The next morning, the sun rises over the castle but Sofia is startled awake by a rooster to find herself in an unfamiliar bedroom, James asleep in the other bed and Amber next to her. She wakes up Amber, who screams loudly in horror when she realises where they are, waking up James and their parents. Trying to take stock of the situation, Roland orders everyone to get dressed while he goes to answer the door. The man who enters startles him by asking him for two loaves of bread, laughing off the notion that they are the royal family rather than simple bakers. Roland realises that his wish must have come true, though doesn't yet know why, and is delighted at the chance to live as a baker rather than as a king. Sofia and Miranda are supportive, though remind him that they used to live in the village and life there isn't any simpler than being king, and James thinks it might be fun but Amber is convinced it will be a disaster. However, James points out that he, Amber and Roland don't know how to bake anything. Sofia and Miranda offer to teach them, but first they will need flour, milk and eggs. The Royal Twins' attempts to get eggs and flour don't work out too well, however; James has to be directed towards the chicken coop after chasing the poor hen around the yard, while Amber takes a drop with the sack of flour and gets chased about by the angry hen. Roland tries to get milk from a cow by ordering it to give him milk, which obviously doesn't work, prompting Sofia and Miranda to step forward and show him how it's done. Roland's first baking attempt goes awry when he sifts the flour a little too enthusiastically, resulting in the whole room being covered in it, and doesn't improve despite his enthusiasm. Amber is ready to go back to the castle but Roland refuses and voices how simple, easy, and fun he thinks life as a villager is. It soon becomes obvious that all four of them are right: Roland is no less busy than he was when he was King, his attempts at baking are disasters that taste worse than they look. Roland is miserable mostly because he has no idea what he's doing but is too stubborn to admit that he was wrong about a villager's life. Finally, Sofia decides to get her stubborn father to just face facts by showing him how much the people of Enchancia need him. When Roland sees how much good he's done as King and how much everyone needs him, Sofia tells him the hard fact about being King: It may be a hard job that's not as simple or as fun as he'd like it to be but someone has to do it and that someone is him. Roland finally realizes that he has been selfish and decides to become King again. Upon remembering the mirror and the sparkle she saw the night before, Sofia realizes it was a magic mirror that grants wishes and when Roland wished he was the baker, it granted it. However, the problem of how they can get back into the castle for the mirror to undo the wish is answered when Baileywick arrives with Amber's cake order, leaving very bemused when Roland hugs him. After much work, they manage to finish the cake; it is so tall the top six layers are knocked off when they take it out the door and James has to restore them with the aid of a rope lift. The family arrives at the castle with the cake for the Villager's Ball and then head for the mirror. Roland asks the mirror to undo his wish which it does, turning Roland and his family back to their royal selves, much to their delight. Baileywick passes by and is delighted to find them since it means the ball can commence, but there are a million things Roland has to do. Roland enthusiastically takes it up, but also orders Baileywick to have the mirror put back in the attic so it doesn't cause any more trouble. The Royal Family arrive for the ball and Roland tells Sofia he's lucky to have a daughter like her since she's always looking out for him whenever he's a King or a baker. Everyone helps themselves to a taste of the lumpy cake, only to find that it tastes nastier than it looks, prompting Roland to promise that the cake will taste better next year."

      "The Crown of Blossoms": " At Enchancia Castle, Sofia is plowing and planting a vegetable garden for Clover so he can grow his own snacks. Clover is grateful for Sofia giving him his own garden, which she says is a great way to celebrate the Festival of Plenty. When Clover asks where his veggies are, Sofia reminds him that gardens take weeks to grow. Just then, Amber and James show up with a tiara that Sofia identifies as the Crown of Blossoms. According to Sofia, the Crown of Blossoms is the center part of the whole Festival of Plenty, that is worn by the Princess of Plenty during the opening ceremony. The Princess of Plenty is a big honor that has always gone to Amber because the Crown is not just pretty, but magical as well. When Amber and James arrive, they tell Sofia that their father has decided to make Sofia the Princess of Plenty this year and Amber is going to coach her through this big responsibility, since she loves to tell people what to do. After the Royal Twins put the Crown on her head and leave, Clover congratulates Sofia and asks her more about the Crown's story. According to her father, King Gideon's wife found the Crown of Blossoms many years ago lying in a big strawberry patch. No one knew who made it, but it was discovered that when a seed from the Crown was planted in the ground all the crops in Enchancia grew better, faster, and more delicious. Because of this, the Princess of Plenty plants a seed in the ground to cause the same effect every year during the Festival. Amazed, Clover asks Sofia if he could have one of the Crown's seeds to plant in his garden, but Sofia refuses since the seeds are not hers to give. She then leaves to prepare for the Festival, just as three seeds fall off the Crown of Blossoms and land in Clover's paws. He calls for Sofia to give them back but changes his mind at the last second. Whatnaught tries to get Clover to give them back but the rabbit's greed encourages him to plant all three seeds into his garden and grow all the vegetables faster than normal. The magically grown vegetables are so delicious that Whatnaught, and especially Clover, quickly get addicted. Suddenly, two gnomes named Fig and Malachite appear through a hole in a nearby tree. They were drawn by the magic pollen that Clover's magical vegetables are giving off. They realize the garden was grown by a seed from the lost Crown of the Gnomes, which they have come to retrieve. When they see Clover, they decide to have him lead them to the Crown. Meanwhile, Amber is helping Sofia get ready. Amber has a whistle on her and harshly blows it several times in Sofia's face when she is not doing something right. During the preparations, Sofia notices a symbol on the Crown of Blossoms and asks Amber about it. She does not know what it is and tells Sofia to focus on the festivities with another harsh whistle blast. Meanwhile, Clover's addiction to his magically grown vegetables has strengthened his greed to a point where he nastily refuses to share his veggies with his friends, which drives them away. Suddenly, Malachite and Fig walk up to Clover and ask him if he has any magic seeds, which he denies. Malachite tells him that is too bad as the vegetables he just harvested will soon be gone, unless he is given some magic seeds that will grow him a supply of never-ending vegetables. The greedy rabbit gives in, and tells the two gnomes about the magic seeds and leads them to the Crown of Blossoms. Meanwhile, Amber and Sofia are in Sofia's room finishing up Sofia's preparations for the Festival. Sofia has changed into her Festival gown, only for Amber to say she has it on backwards. Clover leads Malachite and Fig to Sofia's room where the gnomes find the Crown of Blossoms and take it. Clover realizes he has been tricked and tries to stop them. The commotion attracts Amber's attention. Hearing her coming, Clover and the gnomes hide. When Amber comes out of the closet and sees nothing, she assumes all's well and goes back in to check on Sofia. Once she is gone, Clover tries to stop the gnomes from leaving with the Crown, but they throw a towel over him and escape. Sofia meanwhile finishes putting her outfit on correctly and goes to get the Crown of Blossoms. Once she exits her closet, Sofia frees Clover and finds the Crown gone. Sofia asks Clover if he has seen it, which makes him nervous to the point of speechlessness. Amber comes out and inquires about the Crown, only for Sofia to tell her it is gone. Amber freaks out about the theft and how this will affect the Festival, until Sofia calms her down with a harsh blow of her coach whistle. Sofia sends Amber to stall the festivities until she gets the Crown back. Suspicious about Clover's earlier behavior, she confronts him about it. Clover takes Sofia to his garden. She is shocked by the sight of so many vegetables but she quickly realizes that Clover used one of the Crown's seeds to do this. Clover admits about using the seeds, and then tells Sofia about the gnomes who took the crown. He apologizes to Sofia for letting her down only for Sofia to tell him he let everyone down. Meanwhile, the gnomes are making their way through the castle. Rex finds them but Malachite and Fig scare him away. Elsewhere, Sofia asks Robin and Mia if they have seen the gnomes, but they have not seen anything. They were too upset with a certain rude bunny to notice anything odd. Sofia tells her animal friends to spread out and find the gnomes. Clover offers to help, but he is angrily rejected. Meanwhile, Amber and James try to keep the Festival going but only succeed in leaving the crowd, including their parents, dying of boredom. Elsewhere, Sofia and her animal friends are still searching for the gnomes. Clover shows up with all the vegetables he still has left from his garden, because he has a plan to catch the gnomes and get the Crown back. Because gnomes cannot resist delicious vegetables, Clover succeeds in tricking them and Sofia succeeds in getting the Crown back. However, as they walk away, the gnomes tell Sofia that the Crown of Blossoms is actually called the Crown of the Gnomes, and it belongs to the Gnomes. According to them, Sofia's great-grandmother took it from them by mistake, and all this is proven true when she realizes the symbol on the Crown matches the ones on the Gnomes' hats. At the Festival, Sofia tells everyone the true story about the Crown and makes a deal with the Gnomes: They get the Crown back and share it once a year for the Festival of Plenty, a deal which Roland and Miranda accept. Malachite and Fig place the Crown on Sofia's head and she plants one of its seeds, making the Festival a success."

      "The Royal School Fair": " It is time for the Royal School Fair where every student at Royal Prep is supposed to choose the school where they want to go to after leaving RPA. Every school has put up a tent and presents itself to the students. Sofia enters the fair together with her siblings and meets Clio and Vivian who have decided they want to go to Performing Arts Academy. Zandar is at the tent of the Institute for Science and Alchemy. The Corinthian Sports School is also present. Sofia is very excited. Before looking at all the schools, Amber shows Sofia the \"Wall of Next Steps\", an old tradition, where at noon every student's choice, which are written on a tablet, which they hand to the chiselor who then carves it into stone and puts it on the wall, will be seen. Now it is time for Sofia to visit all the tents. Amber takes her to the one she picked: EverRealm Academy, a school for future rulers and advisors. Meanwhile, James meets Desmond standing in front of the tent of Chivalry Hall and asks him if he is lost, as the Institute for Science and Alchemy's tent is somewhere else. Desmond denies this, sharing his dream to become a hero with James. James encourages him to try out even though Desmond is not sure if he would make a good knight. Inside they meet Sir Finnegan who shows them the skills they would learn there, like tossing a javelin. The knight hits the bull's-eye, so do his students, but Desmond, as impressed as he is by the skills of the students and their teacher, misses completely, enforcing his view that he would never make a good knight. Amber on the other hand shows Sofia the tent of EverRealm Academy. She even suggests to Sofia to become her royal advisor one day. King Habib of Tangu shows them how to design a coat of arms for their kingdom. The students are allowed to paint only three symbols on their template. Sofia paints a heart and her family while Amber chooses a ruby, a diamond, and a pearl. Amber is very enthusiastic about Sofia going to school with her, but Sofia states that she can see herself at other schools, too. Hearing music from the Performing Arts Academy tent, she leaves to visit that tent, to Amber's dismay. There she meets not only Vivian and Clio playing magical music but also Sergio Adagio. Hildegard also enters the tent. Sergio introduces the school to them but Hildegard is not interested as she just wants to pick up Clio who while playing a harp doesn't even react to her. So Hildegard's attempts to get her to leave fail and she leaves the tent heartbroken. Vivian and Clio want to write down their choices together with Sofia but she isn't sure because she loves performing but also liked making her coat of arms, and she goes to visit the other tents. On the way she meets Jun and thinks she has trouble deciding too, because everyone except her seems so sure about which school they want to attend. But as it turns out, Jun just has some trouble with her pen and has already chosen to go to the Institute for Science and Alchemy. Sofia goes on to visit the other tents like the Corinthian Sports School, the School for Royal Fashions and the School for Adventure. After seeing everything Sofia is still indecisive of what choice to make as she liked all the schools. Sofia's friends pressure her to finally make a choice, but James remarks she has not visited Chivalry Hall yet. So Sofia, Desmond, and James go there, and they try out jousting. Sofia gets on a horse and is really successful even though it was her first joust ever, but Desmond's lance ends up flying through the tent, ripping its wall and accidentally messing up a potion in the Alchemy tent which it hits. Unbeknownst to the students this makes a suit of armor come alive. Desmond is disappointed because he thinks he will never be a hero and doesn't belong at Chivalry Hall. Desmond finally accepts he will be going to the Institute of Science and Alchemy. Amber appears and asks how Sofia is doing. Sofia reveals how hard it is for her to choose. Amber is worried if she doesn't decide maybe no school will be left for her to go to. She dismisses her sister's concerns about having to make such a permanent decision in one single day. Sofia's friends pressure her though a song to finally make a choice. But the song only makes Sofia break down; she throws her tablet down and runs away. Fauna comes and says that it's time for the unveiling of the wall. After the other students follow Fauna, Amber picks up the tablet and decides to choose for her sister despite knowing it's wrong. She writes down EverRealm Academy and hands it over to the chiselor. Desmond helps Zandar clean up the damage his little mishap caused and is sad about giving up his dream to become a hero. James confronts him about this, but Desmond tells him, he has to face that Science is where he belongs. The fairies lead the children to the wall. Amber, however, wants to tell Sofia about the choice she made and finds her sister sitting on a bench. When Amber tells Sofia the favor she did for her, Sofia is horrified and angry at her sister for making such a choice for her without asking. Amber is shocked and hurt as she was only doing a helpful favor for her sister. Before Amber can say a word, Sofia storms off and tries to stop the plate from appearing at the wall with Amber going after her. Meanwhile Zandar, Desmond, and James notice the suit of armor destroying the tents. Desmond explains to James that the potion made the suit come alive. Not only does the suit damage the equipment but it also blocks Sofia's path to the wall. James runs to help his sister with to swords but is unable to get the suit to step aside, so is Sofia by using words and a sword. Suddenly Desmond comes to the rescue with a potion that James pours on the armor and it stops moving. Sofia finally gets to the wall. Desmond, meanwhile, gets declared a hero and finally realizes he does not have to become a knight to be a hero as he can also be a hero alchemist. Sir Finnegan even tells him that knights and alchemists have worked together for centuries to protect their kingdoms. It is finally time to unveil the wall, but Sofia arrives too late to change Amber's choice. The fairies give a short speech before the curtain opens and reveals the student's decisions. As it seems, Sofia, Amber, and someone else will go to EverRealm Academy, Hildegard and Kalid will go the School of Royal Fashions, Clio and Vivian decided to attend Performing Arts Academy, Zandar, Jun, and Desmond are going to go to the Institute of Science and Alchemy, James and two others will attend Chivalry Hall, and Zooey and Frederick will attend the School for Adventure. Hildegard and Clio congratulate Amber on her choice. Clio and Hildegard are on one hand sad because they will follow different paths from now on but are happy because they can fulfill their dreams. Sofia is shocked seeing her picture set in stone on the wall. As Vivian wants to congratulate her, she refuses to accept it. Sofia grabs the chisel and breaks her picture off the wall. The others are shocked about what she did. As Merryweather confronts her, Sofia apologizes but tells her that she just wasn't able to make such a big decision in one day, because she doesn't know what to do yet. Amber insists that Sofia had the most fun with her at EverRealm, but Sofia shoots this down, saying that she had fun at all the schools. As it turns out, some of her friends weren't quite sure either. Merryweather calms them down and explains the purpose of this tradition: Even though everyone has to make a choice someday, this choice doesn't have to be permanent yet, as Fauna goes on. Merryweather even reveals to them that she wanted to be a tooth fairy once before noticing it wasn't the right path for her and she went on do to something different. The fairies change the wall by putting boards with chalk and sponges on it where once the stone plates sat, so the students have to make a choice but they are able to change it if they are not sure. The students go and write their choices down. Amber talks to Sofia, revealing she does not want to go off in a different direction as her sister. Sofa forgives her, telling her to ask before doing such a thing again. In the end, she accepts EverRealm Academy for now."

      "The Flying Crown": " In the flying derby, Sofia and James are racing against the riders from Weslock and holding last place. Sofia instructs James to give her a wing blast. James drops back and does so, enabling her to fly ahead and take the lead. Soon, both Sofia and James are in the lead but Weslock's team is catching up. Sofia suggests James races ahead while she holds them off by blocking their way with a double swerve. James, with a huge lead, crosses the finish first with Sofia second, winning for Royal Prep. The audience cheers for Sofia and James' victory except Prince Hugo who is sulking beside his older brother, Axel. Everyone is delighted that Sofia and James are now in the championships and the next race will be for the Flying Crown trophy against the riders of the Junior Knights Academy. The Junior Knights are tough, and they win every year. James believes they can win and starts to imagine the team plays they will do until he trips on a rock and sprains his wrist. Since James can't ride in the championship race, Sir Gillium brings in Prince Hugo to take his place as Sofia's teammate. Sofia hopes they can make amends and put aside what happened in the tryout race by working together, but Hugo only states they don't need team plays to win, just him crossing the finish line first. The next day, Sofia and Minimus meet up with Hugo and his new flying horse Electra, whom Minimus is nervous about while Sofia is more nervous about Hugo himself. Sir Gillium shows up with James as an assistant coach and tells Sofia and Hugo a few things about the riders of Junior Knights Academy. They are known to be the toughest opponents Royal Prep has ever competed against. If Sofia and Hugo are going to win the Flying Crown, they have to practice their team plays. Sofia asks Sir Gillium about a new team play she wants to try with Hugo called the flying slingshot, the most difficult play in flying derby where in mid-air the riders have to line up side by side, reach across their horses and grab hands, spin in a circle and then the biggest rider has to sling the smallest rider forward at just the right moment. Sofia hopes they could practice that play, but Hugo has no interest in team plays and proudly rides off to practice alone. Minimus tells Sofia they don't need him, but she states that they do and that's the problem. Later in the day after school, Sofia heads for the stables just as Amber notices something's bothering her. Sofia tells her friends Hugo doesn't want to practice with her and she doesn't know what to do, but she knows she can't give up on this. Amber tells Sofia this championship is the school's chance to finally win the Flying Crown and she must not let Hugo ruin it. Just then the two riders from the Junior Knights Academy, Squires Vaughan and Vance, arrive at Royal Prep a day early to practice on the course. When Hugo meets them, Vaughan challenges him to a small race around the school and easily beats him. Hugo is upset over losing again, but he still doesn't want to practice team plays with Sofia. She tries to cheer him up by singing the cheer, but it only makes him feel bad and walks away. Electra explains to the little Princess that everyone in Hugo's family have been cheered for winning the Flying Derby, except him. Sofia begins to understand that Hugo is feeling left out and wants to have the same experience. She manages to reason with him, telling him that she knows his father was on the flying derby team when he was at Royal Prep. Hugo also says that his brother, uncle, and grandfather were also on the team when they were each at Royal Prep, and Sofia knows that none of them have won the championship race or the Flying Crown. She tells him that they have a chance to do that. If they do the flying slingshot, not only will they win the championship race, but Hugo will be the first in his family to win the Flying Crown and the school will cheer for him. Thinking about this, Hugo finally agrees to try the flying slingshot with Sofia. Since it's getting late, the Prince and Princess agree to practice early in the morning before the race. Meanwhile James is given a new job to groom the flying horses and gives Minimus and Electra a scrub down only to end up making a mess in the stables. Sir Gillium finally comes up with the perfect job for James: Royal Prep's mascot. The next day, Sofia and Hugo are ready to do some last minute practice on the course. Since Hugo is bigger and stronger than Sofia, she'll need him to sling her. However, Hugo points out that it'll result in Sofia crossing the finish line first, and Sofia says only one of them has to cross for the team to win and that it doesn't matter to her if Hugo crosses first. Hugo foolishly decides to take advantage of this by having Sofia sling him. The first try doesn't go well as it turns out Sofia is only strong enough to fling Hugo off his horse. Again and again no matter how many times, Sofia keeps flinging Hugo off his horse. After landing in the fountain and having his buttons pushed by his brother, Hugo quits by throwing away his team jersey and walks away in frustration. Electra is disappointed by him and tells Sofia and Minimus that Hugo's biggest problem is that while he's a good rider, he doesn't know the first thing about being a good teammate, and therefore doesn't understand what being a true champion is all about. Sofia sees James dressed as the team mascot and making a lot of noise, which sparks an idea for her to help inspire Hugo. It is now time for the Flying Derby championship and the first team to cross the finish wins the Flying Crown. The defending champions Vaughan and Vance arrive on the course, but Sofia and Hugo don't show up when they are announced. James knows how to get the team to come out. Sofia finds Hugo hiding in the stables. She tries to tell him what he's doing is selfish and she can't race without him but Hugo is too upset to listen. However he does listen when he hears the crowd making a lot of noise. Sofia brings him out to the course, and it turns out that James and the crowd are singing the cheer for Royal Prep's team much to Hugo's surprise. Listening to the lyrics of the song/cheer, Hugo finally understands that it's not all about winning; it's about being part of a team. Electra gives Hugo his jersey back and he puts it back on ready to race with Sofia. At last, Sofia and Hugo arrive on the course and join Vaughan and Vance, who are jealous of Hugo for his budding friendship with Sofia. When Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather give the word, the four riders take off with Vaughan and Vance holding an early lead. Sofia and Hugo try to pass them as they go under the bridge, but Vaughan and Vance perform the double swerve, making it hard to get around them. Sofia gives Hugo a wing blast allowing him to fly ahead but it's not enough to catch the Junior Knights. After passing the bell tower, Sofia and Hugo are running out of time as they get near the finish. Sofia says they need to try the flying slingshot which Hugo agrees, but only if they do it right: he insists on slinging Sofia since she's too little to sling him, and it's the only way the team can win. Hugo and Sofia line up side by side, reach across their horses and grab each other's hands. With everyone watching in worry, Sofia and Hugo begin to spin in a circle while in mid-air and then at the right moment Hugo successfully slings Sofia and Minimus into the lead, and Royal Prep wins much to the surprise of Vaughan and Vance. Sofia and Hugo are rewarded with the Flying Crown and the crowd cheers on for them. Amber compliments the team on their success, and Axel proudly tells everybody that Hugo takes after him. But Hugo reminds Axel that he takes after Sofia, who blushes happily, pleased that she and Hugo are friends now."

      "King for a Day": " The Royal Family is having pancakes for breakfast when James turns up riding on wheeled shoes that he calls “Rolling Wheely Shoes” and states that he plans to give everyone a pair when he becomes King. Roland tells his son that there is more to being King than just having fun, it’s about being responsibile, and Miranda adds it's also about being generous, brave and polite. James feels so sure he's all those things, Roland decides to make him King for the Day while he and Miranda go to the Ever Golden Glades to do some Phoenix watching. Before leaving, Roland places a crown James's head making him “King James for the Day.” Amber decides to go with her parents since she thinks James is going to make a mess of everything and wants to make sure their father gets back in time to see it and make him wish he should have made her Queen For The Day first. After Roland, Miranda and Amber leave, everyone heads to the Throne Room where Baileywick presents James’ Royal Duties: Approve a thousand documents by reading them first, choose a new coat of arms for the Royal Scribes, find a way to get the castle servants' jobs done faster and deal with an old abandoned house in the village. Just then, Ruby and Jade show up saying there is a sleeping giant in a cave near the village and his snoring is keeping everyone awake at night. Seeing how difficult it is being King, James isn't sure he can handle it but Sofia manages to encourage him to come up with creative ideas to solve all these problems. Using a pogo-stick, James stamps the documents in no time and has Cedric magically give the servants Rolling Wheely Shoes, helping them move faster around the castle and getting their jobs done in no time. With his confidence built up, James decides to be the King of Fun and makes Sofia his Royal Adviser. Meanwhile, Roland and Miranda have arrived at the Ever Golden Glades and already spot a Phoenix. Just when Miranda gets the chance to draw it, Amber calls out so loud for them she scares the Phoenix causing it to burn up but it rises from the ashes and flies away. Amber tries to convince her father that making James King was a bad idea and he might make a mess of everything but Miranda is confident that James is doing fine. James and the others arrive at the village and instantly hear the snoring giant with Sofia stating \"No wonder no one's getting any sleep.\" James decides to throw a party to cheer up the sleepy villagers and turn the old house into gingerbread and the pond into chocolate milk. Sofia feels these ideas will make more problems but James is sure of himself. Soon, the village is full of loud music, food, games and everyone is having a good time but it still hasn't stopped the giant's snoring. So James orders to have the music louder but the giant’s snoring can still be heard. When James decides on having Cedric conjure fireworks, Sofia, Jade, Ruby and Cedric are all against it as that could wake the giant up, but James doesn't listen and tells Cedric to do it. With the wave of his wand, Cedric launches the biggest, brightest, and loudest fireworks across the sky. Unfortunately, the loud noise of the fireworks wakes up a baby giant who heads for the village stomping and crying. Everyone runs to the gingerbread house for shelter. As the baby giant starts tearing the gingerbread house down, everyone turns to James as he’s the King but James feels he can’t solve this problem and throws away his crown. Sofia tells her big brother one of the hard facts about being King: It's not about having fun, it's about doing what's best for the Kingdom and being a good leader. James finally comes to see he got carried away with being King and thanks to her help they come up with a way of putting the baby giant to sleep by giving him a bedtime snack using the gingerbread walls and the chocolate milk pond. While everyone makes preparations, James gets the baby giant to chase him back to his cave while riding his pogo-stick. They reach the cave and as soon as the baby giant sees his snack, he immediately helps himself and with the help of a lullaby played by the village musicians, the baby tiredly heads back to the cave and goes back to sleep. Just then, Roland, Miranda and Amber return from Phoenix watching just in time to hear what has been happening. Roland is very proud to hear how Sofia and James handled the baby giant and next time promises to make Sofia 'Queen For The Day', much to Amber’s fury. After having Cedric magically create a huge door to the cave silencing the baby giant’s snoring, the Royal Family heads home to find the servants still wearing Rolling Wheely Shoes."

      "Best in Air Show": " Sofia and Minimus are flying through the sky when Sofia's grandmother, Grand Mum, flies by in her carriage. Back at Enchancia Castle, the rest of the Royal Family has learned Grand Mum is coming and Roland is frantically getting everything ready for the arrival of his mother, the Grand Queen of Enchancia. Grand Mum arrives and tells them that Count Barnstorm's Flying Starwing horse show is coming to Enchancia. Minimus calls Sofia over and tells her the stars of Count Barnstorm's show are his parents: When Mazzimo left home, they practiced Stunt Flying as a hobby. They were so good that their stable master started a show with them as the stars. Sofia is excited to meet Minimus's parents and when the Starwings arrive, they fly up to meet Minimus's parents, Gemina and Argus. Gemina and Argus are happy to meet Sofia but are revealed to not like how fast he was flying. Minimus explains he has grown up a lot since he left home and he and Sofia tell Gemina how many Flying Derby races they have won. However, Gemina is not impressed due to not even knowing what Flying Derby is. A dejected Minimus wants to prove himself to his parents so Sofia decides they should enter the Starwing's Amateur Stunt Flyer Contest that will take place on Sunday. Meanwhile back at Enchancia Castle, Grand Mum tries to sneak into the Royal Stable but is caught by Amber and James. Grand Mum tells the twins that she wants to be in the same Stunt Flying contest as Sofia. The twins agree to help her get ready and pick out Windfall as her flying horse and make her some Flying Stunt clothes. Meanwhile, Sofia and Minimus are getting ready to practice when Mazzimo, who is there to see his parents' show, walks up. Minimus tells his brother what he is going to do and Mazzimo decides to watch. Sofia and Minimus do their routine but they are interrupted by Gemina, who forbids Minimus from entering the contest. Sofia and Minimus try to convince her to reconsider, but Gemina does not listen. Mazzimo and Sofia urge him to enter the contest anyway. The next day, Sofia and Minimus are about to do their routine but get caught by Gemina, who insists that her son wears padding. The padding fouls up their routine in a way that makes them crash. Utterly humiliated, Minimus walks away feeling dejected. Grand Mum shows up wearing a mask and takes her turn, but during her routine disaster strikes: The rope that was damaged during Sofia's turn comes undone and a hoop falls on her. Minimus saves her in a way that reveals who she is to Roland. Grand Mum tells her son she felt he could not handle the truth. Gemina apologizes to her son and together with Mazzimo and Grand Mum put on a spectacular show."

      "The Mystic Isles The Princess and the Protector": " On the Mystic Isles, The Protectors are having a meeting in their castle. Orion and Vega have decided that the time has come for Sofia to begin her training as Protector of the EverRealm. Orion and Vega know that training her for the job will be a great challenge and honor for her trainer. For this reason, they have picked Chrysta to be Sofia's trainer. The other Protectors object on the grounds that Chrysta is too arrogant, pushy, and inexperienced as a teacher to be suitable as Sofia's trainer. Vega and Orion reminds them that Chrysta is also smart and fierce which makes her perfect as a trainer. Chrysta comes and asks what is next for her when she sees Sofia in the Crystal Ball. Orion tells her that Sofia is the one who stopped Prisma and is going to be her new student. Chrysta refuses since she does not want to teach \"some pampered Princess who cannot even put on her gown without help from her maid.\" Orion and Vega tell her to do it for the sake of the EverRealm which Chrysta reluctantly does. Meanwhile, Sofia is riding in the Royal Coach to somewhere. Suddenly, the coachman vanishes and one of the wheels on the Coach comes off. When Sofia notices this, she gets the horses to stop. Chrysta appears and reveals that she caused the coach to go out of control. Sofia recognizes her as a Protector and Chrysta tells her Orion assigned her to be her trainer. Sofia's first assignment is to get her own Enchantlet on the Isle of Forever Frost by sundown or she cannot be a Protector. Sofia tells her she understands which Chrysta dismisses by stating she is not so sure she does as the Isle of Forever Frost is the most difficult and treacherous terrain in the Mystic Isles. After Chrysta summons a unicorn, they fly to the Mystic Isles. Upon arriving on the Isle of Forever Frost, Chrysta tells Sofia she cannot use the powers her Amulet gave her to help her get her Enchantlet, which Sofia agrees to. On the way to the area, Chrysta explains the first skill Sofia needs to learn: Feather Walking, walking on ice and snow. Sofia has trouble but starts to grasp it. Sofia asks for more tries to grasp it but Chrysta refuses telling her she does not get special treatment just because she is a princess and questions if she is tough enough. Seeing how Chrysta views her, Sofia asserts that she is despite what she thinks. On the way to the next stop, Sofia is practicing Feather Walking. Chrysta contacts the other Protectors and tells them things are going badly. The other Protectors tell her that is because she needs to do a better job as a Trainer. Chrysta reluctantly helps Sofia and she gets Feather Walking down. They then move on to the next phase of Sofia's training: Beast Wrangling. For the training, Chrysta takes a Calming Collar off a Baronga, causing him to run wild. Sofia tries to collar the Baronga by mounting it, but the Baronga throws her off and lunges at her while she is stunned. This brings the Amulet to send out a beam of light to distract the Baronga and save Sofia. Sofia quickly uses the Amulet's light as a cat toy to calm the Baronga and lure it towards her, but Chrysta ruins Sofia's attempt to calm the Baronga, and causes it to escape. Chrysta continues to remain dismissive of Sofia and, when they get to the Glazing Glacier, tells Sofia she can give up if she gets in trouble as she cannot help her. Annoyed, Sofia tells Chrysta she has not been much help anyway. Sofia gets past the Articondors and rescues their son from the Baronga, who ruins Sofia first attempt to get her Enchantlet. Chrysta tells Sofia she cannot get her Enchantlet now but can go back to her life as Princess. Good and fed up, Sofia tells Chrysta off for being prejudiced against her and for being such a poor trainer. Realizing she is right, Chrysta apologizes to her and goes off to tame the Baronga but accidentally leaves the Calming Collar behind. Hitching a ride on the female Articondor, Sofia goes after her. Sofia rescues Chrysta before getting her Enchantlet. Sofia agrees to let Chrysta continue to be her Trainer and rides the Baronga back down the mountain after Chrysta teaches her how to use her Enchantlet. Chrysta tells Sofia they should call her Sofia the First, which Sofia likes the sound of."

      "The Mystic Isles A Hero for the Hoodwinks": " Sofia and her animal friends are taking a stroll in Dunwiddie Village, when suddenly, the Baker's horse Biscuit gets loose. Luckily, Sofia leaps on Biscuit and stops her from going over an under construction bridge. The Baker thanks her and gives her a pie. Sofia's animal friends praise her heroics. Clover voices his hope to be as big a hero as Sofia so he can get rewards like pies too. Robin and Mia tease Clover about this aspiration. Sofia tells Clover he's her hero. She gives Clover the pie and heads to the Mystic Isles for Protector training. In the spot where the Leafsong Festival was held, Clover is playing hero with Whatnaught, when Hoodwinks show up. The Hoodwinks are looking for Sofia so they can get her to help them with a problem. Sensing a chance to become a hero, Clover offers to solve their problem for Sofia. When they ask if he’s a Protector, Clover says he is, to Whatnaught's disapproval. After the Hoodwinks assure him he'll get a reward, Clover goes with them to the Mystic Isles on a Unicorn. Meanwhile at the Protectors Castle, Sofia is commencing the next phase of her training: Using her Windwhip. Clover arrives at the Hoodwinks home. A Hoodwink named Halt tells Clover that some Wee Sprites who were chased off the Isle of Wee Sprites are wreaking havoc in one of their trees. He also tells Clover about the Rompkin Romp nearby. Clover tells them he knows how to get rid of Wee Sprites because he and Sofia have dealt with Wee Sprites before and asks Hidey to write him a song for him afterwards. This makes Halt realize that Clover isn't a Protector and goes off to get a real Protector. Halt arrives at the Protectors' Castle and tells Sofia about Clover. Sofia confirms that Clover isn't a Protector and goes back with him. Meanwhile, Clover gets the Wee Sprites to say they want to leave by telling them about the Rompkin Romp. After they leave, the Hoodwinks give Clover sugar plum pies. When Sofia shows up, the Hoodwinks sing Clover the song he asked them to write. Suddenly, they hear a thud from the Rompkins' Groove. Sofia asks Clover how he got the Wee Sprites to say they wanted to leave and he tells her it was the usual way. Sofia, Hidey, and Clover head to the Rompkins, who tell them the Wee Sprites are wrecking their stuff. Sofia asks Clover if he got the Wee Sprites out of the Hoodwinks' Tree by sending them to the Rompkins' home which Clover confirms. Clover decides to send them to the Isle of Fairies but Sofia shuts down this idea by telling him that will just make the problem someone else's problem again. Sofia asks the Wee Sprites why they aren't on their own Isle and they tell her they were chase off by Badger Birds. The trio head to the Isle of Wee Sprites and learn that a Wee Sprite named Buzzer accidentally caused the Badger Bird infestation by bringing one back from the Isle of Magical Birds and using a Cloning Potion on it as a prank. Clover tries to end the infestation by trapping the Birds inside Buzzer’s house only to learn the Cloning Potion is inside too. Sofia asks Clover why he did that to which he tells her he wanted to be a hero and get rewards. Sofia tells Clover she doesn't do her good deeds for rewards but because she wants to help. Working together, Sofia and Clover end the infestation. The trio take the Birds back to their Isle and go back to tell the Wee Sprites they can go home. After they head home, Sofia tells Clover he's her hero."

      "Clover Time": " Sofia and Clover are in a hammock outside watching the clouds when it starts raining. When Clover gets back to his rabbit hole, it's flooded. Sofia invites Clover to move in and they celebrate being roommates. When Sofia wakes up, she discovers Clover has made a mess of her room by having \"a midnight snack.\" When Sofia heads down to breakfast, her parents tell her that Bryce Twigley, a famous artist, is coming to paint portraits of every room in the castle. Meanwhile, Amber becomes obsessed with finding out if she's discovered a new star after Master Erwin tells her she can name it anything she wants.

Clover doesn't listen when Sofia tells him he's the one causing problems and leaves in a huff. Clover soon discovers what Sofia was talking about and how much of an inconsiderate and freeloading slob he'd been after he gets booted out of Whatnaught's hollow and spends some time in Rex's doghouse. Meanwhile, Sofia feels guilty about making Clover feel bad. When Bryce Twigley arrives, he first paints Amber in her room with the telescope. When he visits Sofia's room to get her for a portrait, she sadly starts talking like Clover, to her parents' confusion.

      "The Buttercups": " At the castle, Sofia is with her Girl Scout troop known as the Buttercups showing her friends how to make a friendship knot when their troop leader, Helen Hanshaw, introduces two new recruits, Meg and Peg. Sofia gives them their Buttercup vests and, when they ask about the badges she's wearing, she explains in order to get their own they must earn them. Helen announces that tomorrow they will be going on a hike through Peppertree Forest. Sofia is very excited about the hike because she's only one badge away from finally earning the Sunflower Medallion, a great honor Sofia has been looking forward to earning since she first became a Buttercup. After the Buttercups leave, Sofia welcomes her father home and tells him about the hike tomorrow. But almost immediately, she wishes she hadn't spoken because Roland is against Sofia going into the forest, concerned that something might happen to her. Miranda tries to assure her husband that he has nothing to worry about because of Sofia's Buttercup experience and because Helen will be there to provide supervision. Baileywick also supports Sofia going, stating his experience as a Groundhog and how it gave him the skills he uses as the castle steward. Hearing this, Roland decides to make Baileywick Sofia's royal escort by having him accompany her and make sure she comes home safely without a single scratch. Sofia protests that such a thing is unnecessary because she'll be fine on her own. Roland only tells her he just wants her to be safe and Baileywick promises her she'll have a good time. Realizing there's no changing her father's mind, Sofia reluctantly accepts having Baileywick as her escort. The next day, Sofia is all ready to go on the hike but Baileywick overdoes his own packing in a way that ensures that he and Sofia both arrive extremely late. Baileywick also leaves Sofia flustered by providing a Royal entrance and then explaining to the troop that he is going to accompany Sofia \"On the King's orders.\" to ensure Sofia's safety on the hike. Helen says he can come as long as he can \"keep up with the Buttercups.\" Soon the hike begins and along the way to their first stop, Baileywick starts to baby Sofia much to her chagrin. When they arrive, Baileywick scoops Sofia into a throne. Despite getting out of the chair and stating she will be fine sitting on the ground with everyone else, Baileywick just scoops her back into it and hands her some ice water. Helen assigns the troop their first badge-earning project: building birdhouses. Baileywick butts in and starts to build a birdhouse for Sofia despite her protests that she can do it herself. Helen refuses to give Sofia the birdhouse badge because she knows Baileywick built it when Sofia was supposed to build it by herself and tells Baileywick that scouts only get badges if they do the projects by themselves but it doesn't sink in. So due to Baileywick's interference, Sofia misses out on earning a badge, much to her disappointment but she says nothing because she understands he was only trying to help. Along the way to the next stop, Baileywick tries to roll a red carpet out across the river for Sofia but Helen rolls it back and tells him to let Sofia cross by herself. Baileywick protests that the rocks she has to cross on are slippery but Sofia gracefully hops across all of them and makes it across safe and sound. In the end, the only one who ends up slipping and falling is Baileywick. At the next stop, Helen gives the troop their next badge earning project: gathering wood for their cookout. Sofia finds a log with a squirrel on it and politely asks the squirrel to let her have the log when he's done eating. But Baileywick interferes once again and starts grabbing all the logs he can carry to the chagrin of both the squirrel and Sofia, who tries to stop him and get her own wood at the same time but Baileywick is too fast for her. Helen once again refuses to give Sofia a badge and tells Baileywick that a job well done only counts when Sofia does it by herself but it still doesn't sink in. Ruby and Jade can see that Baileywick's mollycoddling is bothering Sofia so they urge their friend to tell him to stop butting in. When the cookout begins, Baileywick grabs Sofia's hot dog and begins to cook it for her. Sofia finally has had enough and tells Baileywick straight up that the Buttercup projects are things she can and must do by herself and reminds him that he promised her she would have a good time. At the troop's next stop, Helen gives the troop their next badge earning project: flower gathering. Once again, Baileywick interferes but the flowers he ends up picking for Sofia are the very ones he was trying to protect her from: Meddelsome Myrtle, a poisonous flower that causes a red rash, itching and swelling as Baileywick discovers first-hand. Helen manages to treat his condition but recommends they head back so Baileywick can receive full medical attention. However they notice the trail down the hill is so twisty that it could be difficult for Baileywick to climb down. Sofia finds another way down which is not so steep or twisty and with an idea from Meg and Peg, the Buttercups work together to build a sled to slide down the grass. In no time, they complete the sled and, after being equipped with safety helmets, they slide down to the bottom of the hill and head back to the castle. Sofia's leadership earns her the leadership badge which also earns her the Sunflower Medallion."

      "Winter's Gift": " It's Wassalia, and Sofia wakes up to finds a present on her bed with Clover inside it. Sofia thanks Clover and shows him the gift she made for Cedric: A wand case for his wand. But when she goes up to give it to him, she hears him ranting about how he wants a special gift. This makes Sofia feel her gift isn't special enough and goes off looking for another one. When she meets Baileywick, he tells her about Ice Lilies which gives her an idea on the perfect gift to get Cedric for Wassalia. She and Clover head out into the forest and meet up with Whiskers the Fox, an old friend of Clover's. He agrees to take them to the ice lilies. On the way, they meet a faun named Winter. Winter tells Sofia the reason she's out in the Icicle Forest is because she's also looking for ice lilies to give them to Glacia the Ice Witch. A year ago, Winter gave all the wood crystals she could find to Glacia, who does spells for people who bring her gifts every year on Wassalia, in exchange for the ice touch because she heard about a princess with ice powers and thought it would be cool to have a magical power. Glacia granted her request and gave her the ice touch. At first, Winter thought it was a nice power until she froze one of her friends by mistake. She now wants to find a gift for Glacia and ask her to remove the ice touch. Sofia agrees to help her new friend find the perfect gift for Glacia. Together, thanks to Whisker's information network and Winter's ice touch, they manage to find the ice lilies and Clover and Whiskers get them for the girls in a competitive way. But Clover falls out of the tree and Winter catches him and freezes him solid in the process by accident, to Winter's horror. They head for Glacia's palace but Glacia, because she already has hundreds of ice lilies, refuses to remove the ice touch. A saddened Winter runs off into the woods with Sofia going after her. Sofia is at a loss of what to do when her amulet starts to glow. The frozen Clover recognizes this means a princess summoning is happening and Tiana appears. After Sofia ask her how can Winter find a perfect gift for Glacia, Tiana tells her that a true gift comes from the heart. This inspires Sofia to tell Winter she should use her music and make one of her songs a gift for Glacia. Winter does so which makes Glacia happy enough to remove the ice touch and undo all the freezings. Glacia reveals that the reason she was so bitter is because she was tired of receiving trinkets from selfish people who only see her when they want something and Winter's gift was the first true gift she has ever received. Winter and Sofia both go their own homes to celebrate Wassalia with their families, including Clover and Whiskers. Finally, Cedric and Sofia both give each other gifts and Cedric likes the wand case she made for him."

      "The Birthday Wish": " On a bright sunny morning, Princess Sofia is woken up by Clover, who wishes her a Happy Birthday and presents her with a Propeller Plum for her Birthday breakfast. Baileywick comes in with a new dress for Sofia to wear at the Birthday party. Clover tells Sofia it is going to be a great day. Not only will she be having a party with all her friends and get a lot of gifts, she and her father will also lead the dancing. However, the good morning spirit is ruined when Clover accidentally gets plum juice on Sofia's new dress. Her animal friends try to get the stain off, but end up tearing a part of her dress. While Clover still believes her birthday will still be great, Sofia now has doubts. Sofia is later greeted by Ruby and Jade, who showed up early to help set up the party. As a surprise, they put Sofia's face on all the balloons and party hats. Vivian and Crackle have also come early to help set up the party too. Suddenly, due to having hiccups, Crackle accidentally lets out a burst of fire that pops all the balloons. Sofia remains assured that everything is going to be great, but the morning continues to go bad. Amber is annoyed because James stuck his finger in the cake, and James' present to Sofia, an enchanted flying toy carriage, gets loose the moment he launches it. So far, everything on Sofia's birthday is going wrong. Miranda and Roland assure Sofia that she is just having a bad start and that things will turn around. During the party, things start going right, which makes up for all the early mishaps. Crackle even gets cured of her hiccups. However, things go wrong once again. James' gift, chased by Rex, collide into Crackle and crash into the Birthday cake and party hats. Roland and Sofia try to salvage what is left of the party by having their Father Daughter Dance, but the floor is a mess. Sofia's Birthday party is ruined. Tizzy arrives late at the party, which is now over. She notices Sofia looking very upset about her Birthday not turning out the way she hoped. She wishes on a Birthday candle to relive her birthday so she can make it a happy one. Feeling sorry for Sofia, Tizzy grants her wish. The next day, Sofia is shocked beyond belief to discover that it is her birthday again. Sofia is at first confused until Tizzy shows up reveals that she granted her wish. Much to Sofia's joy, she decides to take this opportunity to have a happier Birthday from before. She manages to keep her dress from getting ruined. However at the party, Crackle again pops the balloons due to her hiccups, only for one to be saved. Sofia also stops James from flying her toy carriage by putting it under a tray cover. Despite confusing her family and friends with her displays of foresight, Sofia is having a much happier Birthday this time. However, when they get to the Father Daughter Dance, Roland accidentally tears Sofia's dress. Things get worse when James send the toy carriage flying. Rex goes after it and trashes everything again. Despite having another ruined Birthday, Sofia is just thankful that it is over. The next day however, Sofia is shocked to discover that it is her birthday again. She calls out for Tizzy, who reveals that, because she wanted to have a happy Birthday when she made her wish, she will keep reliving her Birthday until she has a truly happy one. Sofia resolves to make her Birthday trouble-free to break the spell. After reliving her Birthday thirty-seven times, a tired and exhausted Sofia finally keeps everything from going wrong and is confident the spell is broken. However, Sofia discovers the next day she is going to relive her birthday for the thirty-eighth time as trouble-free is not the same as truly happy. She is ready to call it quits, but Clover tells her she needs to look on the bright side. Once again, Clover stains Sofia's dress with Propeller Plum juice. Instead of being upset, she sees a bright side to this. She has Clover bring in more plums, and splats her dress with more juice until it is covered in polka-dots. Sofia then shows up at the party in her new improved dress. When Rex trashes everything, Sofia makes no big deal of it. She knows that despite any mishaps she will have a great birthday because she has all her friends and family to celebrate it with. The next day, Sofia learns that, because she finally had fun on her birthday, she broke the spell. Clover notes it is raining, but Sofia tells him they just have to look on the bright side."

Sofia and Jade tell her they're on their way to the go-carriage shop to get parts and asks if she wants to come. Ruby tells her friends she's already got the parts for her go-carriage for the Dinwiddie Pedal Power Race this year. It's always been Ruby's dream to win that race but she's never won before. After her friends leave, Ruby tries to put the wheels on her go-carriage but she drops one and it rolls into the river. Once there, Ruby meets Tizzy, a wingless Fairy Godmother, who tells her she doesn't have her wings yet because she has to earn them by making someone's dream come true which has always been hard for her since all her attempts to help her previous Godkids ended up leaving them seriously hurt and publicly humiliated. Ruby lets her help finish her go-carriage and Tizzy teaches Ruby how to summon her. Meanwhile, Sofia and Jade are having trouble finding parts for their go-carriages. Eventually, they salvage parts at the castle. They meet up with Ruby and are shocked to see she's already finished her go-carriage so fast. After pedaling away, Ruby summons Tizzy and tells her she feels guilty that she didn't tell her friends about how she helped her. Tizzy tells her that there's nothing wrong with getting help and that's what Fairy Godmothers are for. Sofia and Jade arrive at Ruby's house and find out about Tizzy and her status as Ruby's Fairy Godmother. Jade realizes that the reason Ruby's go-carriage was finished so fast was because Tizzy made Ruby's go-carriage for her and is furious. Ruby tells Jade that she and Sofia are helping each other and that James and Amber are getting lots of help with their go-carriages. Sofia agrees that Tizzy helping Ruby isn't against the rules, and she and Jade leave to finish their own preparations for the race. Ruby resumes getting ready for the race with Tizzy going with her. However, Ruby is starting to get annoyed by how Tizzy isn't letting her do anything on her own. On the day of the race, Ruby is worried she won't be fast enough so Tizzy uses her magic to make the pedals move on their own. During the race, Amber's go-carriage gets stuck and takes all the other racers except Sofia and Ruby out of the race. Afterwards, Sofia notices the pedals on Ruby's go-carriage moving all by themselves and realizes Tizzy has enchanted her's to move on it's own. Suddenly, disaster strikes as they come towards a turn. Unable to control her go-carriage, Ruby goes off the track and crashes into a barn. Tizzy appears to help her out but Sofia tells Ruby she can't get any more help from Tizzy because depending on her magic to win the race is cheating. Sofia also tells Tizzy that a little assistance is nice but Ruby's dream coming true will only count in a way that will earn her wings if she wins fair and square and the pair agree with her. Tizzy then uses her magic to do a do-over for the race and Ruby wins which earns Tizzy her wings, to their joy."

She is looking forward to the Highland Hootenanny because her older siblings and friends are coming and her favorite band in Enchancia, the Glass Slippers, is playing. Just then, there is a knock at the door and Sofia hides Clover before telling whoever's there to come in. Roland enters and tells Sofia there has been a change of plans: Lord Gilbert and Lady Joy are coming today and since she promised she would show Joy around the castle he needs her at the castle all day. Sofia is disappointed but agrees to do what Roland asks. She asks Clover to help her pick out a gift for Joy. After walking out, Sofia sees Cedric trying out his new copying spell on Wormwood. This give Sofia an idea: she will make a copy of herself with Cedric's copying spell and have her play with Joy while she goes to the hootenanny. She tests the spell on an apple, and it creates a second apple, but it's pink instead of red for some reason. Sofia then uses the spell on herself to create a second Sofia who wears a pink dress. Pink Sofia states that she would be happy to play with Joy. As soon as Sofia leaves, Clover takes a bite out of the pink apple only to find it disgusting and rotten, prompting Pink Sofia to show her true bad colors. This makes Clover realize that Sofia somehow messed up the spell and created a rotten apple and an evil twin. Clover tries to go and warn Sofia, but Bad Sofia grabs him and locks him in Wormwood's cage before running off. Sofia, Amber, and James head to the Hootenanny and Bad Sofia hangs out with Joy and gives her her own amulet. Cedric, unaware that Sofia used his copying spell, is shocked. Bad Sofia quickly gets bored with Joy and lets her play hide and seek then runs off to head to the Hootenanny. Meanwhile, Sofia is dancing at the Hootenanny when the Glass Slippers start singing a song about keeping promises no matter what. As she listens, Sofia begins to feel guilty that she is not doing what she promised her father. She feels even worse when Bad Sofia appears. After showing a horrified Sofia her true colors, she instantly begins to throw the entire Hootenanny into pandemonium. Sofia grabs Bad Sofia, throws her into a barn, and locks her inside. Sofia heads back to the castle but Bad Sofia escapes and follows her back to the castle where she makes even more trouble. Sofia teams up with Joy and Cedric to stop Bad Sofia and give chase all over the castle finally cornering her where Roland and Lord Gilbert are having their meeting leading everyone to find out about the two Sofias. Roland demands an explanation causing Bad Sofia to state \"She made me.\" Sofia tells her father she used Cedric's copying spell to make a copy of herself so she could be in two places at once, much to Roland's disappointment. After Cedric gets rid of the Bad Sofia, Sofia apologizes to her father and Joy for everything that has happened and assures them that she has learned her lesson: When she makes a promise, she's the one who has to keep it, not a copy of herself. Roland and Joy forgive Sofia and she takes Joy to the Hootenanny making herself a new friend."

      "A Royal Mess": " The Goldenwing Circus has come to Enchancia, and Sofia is told how amazing it is by everyone through a lively song and dance. Inside the castle, King Roland is pleased with how the stained-glass window of his family has turned out and is eager to show it to Miranda. His children run up to him and ask if they can go to the circus and he says yes. James does some juggling as he tells Sofia about the circus jugglers while the song and dance resume. When it's all over, Roland reminds James that playing ball inside the castle is not allowed. But right after he leaves, James starts doing it again despite his sisters' protests and one of the balls ends up smashing into the window. Sofia says they should tell their father what happened, but James knows he will not be allowed to go to the circus if they do that, so he suggests they try hiding the smashed part of the window behind a suit of armor. Sofia is unsure of this but, after some pleading from James, she agrees to help him. While pushing it towards the window, they hear their parents approaching and Amber goes to stall them. Sofia and James finish moving the armor in front of the window, but James accidentally knocks over the axe it's holding and it hits the window, putting a huge crack in it. Amber is playing the harp for her parents and the song she plays is so long Roland falls asleep out of sheer boredom and when she finishes, they attempt to leave quickly after she offers to play another, but she stops them and takes them to go look at her new tiara. Sofia thinks it's time to tell their father what's happened but James is determined not to miss the circus, even after Sofia tells him how none of his ideas for hiding the window will work. Sofia suggests Cedric could fix the window with magic. At first, Cedric doesn't want to help but when Sofia's amulet catches his eye he changes his mind. After ushering Sofia and James out, he finishes up a new potion that allows him to cast a spell that pulls small objects, with Sofia's amulet being his target, into his grasp, though in the case of large objects like a bookcase he is pulled towards the object instead. Cedric meets up with Sofia and James and instructs them to stand in front of the window. He casts the spell but Sofia ducks out of the way so his spell hits the window and Cedric is pulled right into it. While Sofia frets over their worsening problem, Amber is showing her various tiaras to their parents. Roland in particular is getting restless and both he and his wife get up and leave with Amber chasing after them now failing to stall them because they now ignore her. Sofia, once again, urges James to go tell their father what happened but James decides to fix the window with magic. Sofia is against the plan but James ignores her causing her to cover her eyes and moan \"I can't look!\" James successfully casts a spell that frees Cedric from the window but shortly afterwards the entire window shatters just as Roland and Miranda arrive. James is about to tell his parents it was his fault when Sofia suddenly steps forward and takes the blame, to everyone's shock. As punishment, Sofia is banned from seeing the Goldenwing Circus and is escorted to her room by Baileywick while her family goes to the Goldenwing Circus. James, who can't understand why Sofia would willingly throw away her chance to see the circus by laying herself down for him, goes after her and asks why she took the blame for him. Sofia tells him she knows how much he loves the circus and she wanted to make sure he got to go see it even if that meant giving up her own chance to see the circus. A guilt ridden James joins his family in the coach and they head for the circus. While setting the table for tea in her room, Baileywick tells Sofia that he knows James was the one who really broke the window and she took the blame for him because he knows that she wouldn't play ball in the castle after her father said not to and James would. He also tells Sofia that taking the blame for James was very kind of her but she still shouldn't have done it because telling a lie, even to help someone stay out of trouble, is still wrong. At the Circus, James continues to feel guilty about letting Sofia take the blame, not even the enjoyment of the Circus can ease his conscience. Finally, the twins tell their parents that James was the one who really broke the window and Amber was trying to keep them from seeing it and that Sofia took the blame so James could go to the circus. Very disappointed, Roland and Miranda escort Amber and James home leaving the Ringmaster a bit worried. After returning home, the King and Queen have a discussion with their kids about the importance of telling the truth: Sofia, James and Amber are all scolded for trying to hide the ruined window from their parents, James is scolded for breaking a castle rule, Amber is scolded for trying to stall them, and Sofia is scolded for the little white lie that she told by both Miranda and Roland who tell her that families need to be honest and not keep secrets from each other especially when things go wrong because that only makes the problem worse. Just then the castle is unexpectedly visited by the Ringmaster of the Goldenwing Circus. Since they left so early, he was concerned that the King and Queen didn't like the show but Roland assures him they love the circus and so do their children. All they had was a family matter to attend to. Relived that everything is all right, the Ringmaster offers to put on a special show right on the castle grounds for the Royal Family. In the end, all five of them get to see the Goldenwing Circus and the broken window is magically restored by the circus Ringmaster."

      "Mystic Meadows": " Sofia and the Buttercups are preparing to visit Mystic Meadows, a rest home for retired sorcerers and where Cedric's mother and father reside, to earn their good deed badges with Baileywick as their troop leader since Ruby's Mother is sick. Sofia invites Cedric to visit his parents but he is not keen on coming since he'll have to see the Family Wand, a powerful wand that's been passed down for many generations in his family that his father won't hand down to him because he doesn't think he's a good enough sorcerer, only because he always interrupts him whenever he is casting a spell in a way that makes him mess it up. Sofia offers to help him get the Family Wand by helping him show his father how great he really is and Cedric accepts. When Cedric and the Buttercups arrive at Mystic Meadows, they are greeted by Cedric's parents: Goodwyn the Great and Winifred the Wise. Winifred greets her son with affection but Goodwin greets him with criticism. Winifred tells the Buttercups about the Mystic Meadows Conjuring Contest she's hosting in the afternoon. While the rest of the troop spend time with the other retired enchanters, Sofia tries to help Cedric show Goodwyn how great he is. But, as Cedric predicted, every time Cedric tries to cast a spell, Goodwyn interrupts him causing him to mess up the spell. In the end, Goodwyn refuses to give him the Family Wand stating he isn't ready and unsure if he ever will be. Cedric protests that these mishaps happened because he interrupted him but Goodwyn doesn't listen. Sofia decides to have Cedric take part in the Conjuring Contest. At first, Cedric is against it because he knows his father is just going to interrupt him again but Sofia tells him she has a plan. During the Contest, Sofia prevents Goodwyn from interrupting by complimenting his wand and with her help Cedric is doing much better. But then, disaster strikes: When Sofia tells them the answer to a riddle is snowman, Cedric and Goodwyn start to quarrel over who should conjure the answer and accidentally turn everyone into snowmen. Cedric tries to fix it but, once again, Goodwyn interrupts him and he accidentally conjures a sun. Sofia finally puts her foot down and tells Goodwyn straight up that the only reason Cedric was messing up is because he had been interrupting him all day and that he can help his son out best by backing off, giving him some space, and letting him do the spell himself. Goodwyn does as Sofia asks and Cedric fixes everything and they win the Conjuring Contest. Before everyone goes home, Goodwyn gives the Family Wand to his son and proclaims him Cedric the Sensational."

      "The Littlest Princess": " The castle is getting ready for the annual Gifting Day Party. While outside picking flowers for the party, Sofia discovers three wee sprites named Button, Benngee, and Brody who are trapped in the water fountain. Sofia rescues them from the fountain and her amulet glows. After making a stray comment about being small, Sofia suddenly shrinks to the same size as the sprites. Thanks to a comment by Benngee, Sofia realizes her amulet has blessed her with the power to shrink to sprite size and back. After Sofia returns to normal, the sprites ask her if they can sleep over and Sofia tells them she has to ask her mother. But Miranda refuses because she's heard negative things about wee sprites from a candle maker she knows. The sprites convince Sofia to sneak them in and, while they play in her dollhouse, her amulet glows again. The next morning, Sofia discovers she's still tiny and tries to get back to normal, but fails. Clover appears and, after hearing what happened, concludes that her amulet has put a curse on her and she needs to get the sprites out of the castle to break it. Sofia and Clover find the sprites \"having fun\" causing trouble around the castle. Meanwhile, Miranda goes around the castle looking for Sofia and finds the damage the sprites caused along the way. When she finds tiny footprints, Miranda realizes what's going on and who's responsible and doubles her efforts to find her daughter. Meanwhile, Sofia tricks the sprites into going outside and tries to return to normal only to discover she's still cursed because of the sprites' teleportation ability, to her despair. Miranda is still looking for Sofia when she discovers the sprites. She chases them into Sofia and discovers her daughter's condition. Sofia tells her about the curse and apologizes for her actions. Miranda tells her the only way to get rid of wee sprites is to make them say they want to leave out loud and comes up with a plan. Sofia doesn't see how her mother's plan will get rid of the sprites, but Miranda sternly tells her daughter that her inability to just trust those around her made her not listen to her which caused this problem in the first place and if she wants to break the curse and get back to normal she needs to just have faith and listen to her this time. Sofia executes her mother's plan in a way that breaks the curse and returns her to normal. Later, after the party, she gives the sprites her dollhouse as their new home."

      "The Secret Library Tale of the Eternal Torch": " At the Castle, Prince James is taking his Junior Knight test in the courtyard under Sir Finnegan's supervision. At first, James does an outstanding job, but when he gets to the wall, he meets his downfall: Instead of climbing over the wall with a ladder, he pole vaults over it with a staff. This proves to be a mistake, for once he is over the wall he lands in a mud puddle. This slows him down and he fails to cross the finish line in time. When Sir Finnegan informs him that he failed the test, James protests because he was not expecting to get caught in the mud, only for Sir Finnegan to tell him that he should have looked before he leaped. Both Roland and Finnegan tell him that he still did well for his first time and can always try again. All he needs is more practice, not just on the course but in the real world as well by going on an adventure. Sofia feels sorry for James, but then suddenly her Amulet starts to glow blue. It is time to go to the Secret Library. After Sofia arrives, the Library selects a book called The Tale of the Eternal Torch. The book goes inside the pendulum and the narrator proceeds to tell her latest story about the dragons who live on the Blazing Palisades and how their island home is under threat by sea monsters. As the story goes, the Sea Monsters want to claim the Palisades for themselves, and intend to replace the Eternal Torch with the Forever Fountain, whose magical waters could drown out the island's fires and chase the dragons away. To give this story a happy ending, Sofia must journey back to the Blazing Palisades and stop the sea serpents from taking over the island. As Sofia hitches one of the flying horses up to a coach, James overhears her talking to the horse about her plans. While she is getting the horse a snack, James climbs inside the trunk on the carriage. Unaware of this, Sofia gives the horse his snack and takes off for the Blazing Palisades. Sofia arrives at the Blazing Palisades and, upon landing, discovers James in the trunk. Taking up Sir Finnegan's advice, James chose to accompany her so he could practice his knight skills. Sofia is far from pleased that her big brother stowed away, but James assures his little sister that he will be a big help. Reluctantly, she agrees to let him help, much to his delight. Just then, they spot some lizards in the distance, which Sofia identifies as the sea monsters who have come to claim the island for themselves. They come onto dry land and begin looking for the trail that leads to the Eternal Torch, which is at the very top of the island. Sofia decides they should go and warn Everburn by sneaking up the trail to his cave, which is also where the Eternal Torch is. However, James runs onto the trail, and unwittingly shows the sea serpents which way to go. He tries to stop them by ordering them, forcing Sofia to save him from getting stomped over. Flambeau and his group come out and greet them. Sofia tells them about the sea monsters. Flambeau identifies their leader, Aqualina, as an old enemy of Everburn. He tells Sofia and James they must take the tunnel that leads to the bridge, where they can intercept the Sea Monsters. Once there, they can stop them by burning down the bridge. James agrees to the bridge burning idea, but refuses to take the tunnel. Instead, he wants to fly there on Smokelee who, much like James, tends to get so caught up in the heat of the moment that he forgets to think things through. James and Smokely take off to stop the sea monsters at the bridge. Nitelite tells Sofia that flying over sea serpents is a bad idea, which is proven true when the sea serpents spot James and Smokely, and shoot them out of the sky with water. By the time Sofia and the others catch up, the pair's recklessness has cost them their chance to stop them at the bridge. James protests, saying he did not know about their ability to shoot water, to which Flambeau sternly states was because they rushed off before getting the facts. Nitelite says they still have time to warn Everburn if they use the tunnels this time. After they do so, Sofia wakes Everburn and tells him what is happening. Everburn and the other dragons prepare for battle. James wants to help, but Everburn tells him to stand aside, and the dragons engage in a singing battle with the sea serpents. When this only causes a stalemate, the dragons decide to block them off by building a wall on the trail. James is fuming about being left out of the action. When he sees a big rock, he decides to add it to the wall and, despite Sofia's protests, sends it rolling. This proves to be a mistake: Instead of strengthening the wall, the rolling rock destroys it. With nothing in their way, Aqualina and the Sea Monsters replace the Eternal Torch with the Forever Fountain, which unleashes an array of torrents that flood the Palisades and washes the dragons out. Aqualina changes the island's name to the Watery Palisades. James wants to fix everything, but Sofia tells him they need a plan first, and reminds him of what Sir Finnegan said. James agrees and, together with the dragons, they come up with a plan to restore the Watery Palisades to being the Blazing Palisades. The dragons distract the sea serpents by breathing fire. This time James listens to Sofia when she tells him to wait. This enables James and Sofia to enter the cave without any problems. They put the Eternal Torch back on its pedestal in a way that merges the Torch's magic with the Fountain's magic. This merge creates a new island that is half-Blazing at the top and half-Watery at the bottom. This convinces Sofia and James to leave things as they are and convince the dragons and sea monsters to make peace. The dragons and sea serpents agree and the Palisades becomes the Misty Palisades. Upon returning home, Sofia goes back to the Secret Library to review the finished story, and then goes to watch James retake his Junior Knight test. This time, the finish line is behind a door. James checks the door instead of busting it down. This proves to be a wise move, for just like before, there is a mud puddle on the other side. Using a plank, James safely crosses the puddle in time to cross the finish line and passes the test. Sir Finnegan congratulates him and promotes him to Junior Knight."

      "The Leafsong Festival": " Sofia's helping her animal friends rehearse for the Leafsong Festival when Crackle arrives and immediately starts causing problems with her fire breathing. Director Dove tells her she can't be in the festival because her fire breathing makes her a hazard. Crackle leaves feeling very rejected and confides in Sofia, who's also not in the show since she's not an animal and the Leafsong Festival is for animals only, that she thinks her fire breathing causes nothing but trouble and wishes she were rid of it for just one day. The two hear Clover and Director Dove talking about how the magic show they were part of went out of business because people prefer magic spells to magic tricks. Hearing this gives Sofia an idea to see Cedric and ask him to help Crackle. They arrive at Cedric's workshop and Sofia introduces him to Crackle and tells him she is having troubles with her fire, which comes out when she doesn't want it to. Crackle instantly proves Sofia's case by accidentally unleashing a fire blast that nearly hits Wormwood. Sofia asks for a spell that can help Crackle with her fire breathing and Cedric offers to cast a spell that will take away her fire and put it in a jar. Sofia doesn't think this is a good idea but Crackle tells her \"Fine by me.\" and Sofia reluctantly agrees. Cedric casts the extraction spell and puts Crackle's fire in a jar. As soon as Sofia and Crackle leave, Cedric reveals that he plans to use Crackle's fire to take over the kingdom: He'll cover the whole kingdom in forever frost to blackmail Roland into handing over his crown and then restore the kingdom with Crackle's dragon fire. Sofia and Crackle head back and Crackle shows everyone that she's fire free. When Crackle can't roast Clover's carrots however, he tells Sofia that he misses Crackle's fire breathing and Sofia tells Clover that she does too. Meanwhile, Robin and Mia are having a spat because Robin's letting all of Director Dove's praise go to her head. Finally, Mia has had enough and leaves in a huff and lands in the pond. Cedric casts the forever frost curse, soon the whole kingdom is covered in forever frost, and Mia is trapped in the frozen pond. Director Dove tells Sofia this is forever frost, since he encountered it once before in the Kingdom of Freezenburg, and tells her that he'll have to cancel the Leafsong Festival since the only thing that can melt it is dragon fire. Clover tries to get Crackle to melt the ice but Crackle reminds him she can't breath fire anymore. Sofia urges Crackle to get her fire back from Cedric. At first, Crackle refuses since getting her fire back means she can't be in the festival until Sofia reminds her that unless she gets it back there won't be a festival and both Enchancia and Mia will remain trapped in the frost. When Crackle hears this, she decides that Sofia is right and decides to get her fire back. Meanwhile, it soon becomes obvious that Cedric's plot isn't going to work because, as usual, he didn't think things through and because of this he drops the jar containing Crackle's fire. Sofia and her friends go after it and get it. The moment Sofia opens the jar, Crackle's fire breath returns to her and she starts to melt the forever frost. While she does so, Robin apologizes to Mia for being such a fathead and the two reconcile. With the frost gone, the Leafsong Festival is able to go on, and Crackle contributes to it with her fire."

      "A Royal Wedding": " Sofia and the Royal Family are preparing for Aunt Tilly's and Sir Bartleby's wedding. James laments about his boring duty, which he has to fulfill as heir to the throne. Not only does he have to remember all the guests' names and homelands, but to greet everyone with their traditional greetings as many different kinds of creatures will attend the wedding. Aunt Tilly, wearing her wedding gown, arrives with wings on her back. She demonstrates how she is able to make them appear and disappear at will by using a Whenever-Wings-Wand. Tilly tells Sofia and Amber that the wand will be used for a special surprise at the end because she wants the wedding to be special. Baileywick calls them as it is time for the Royal Portrait. Before they leave, Tilly asks Sofia to be her maid-of-honor because she made it possible for her aunt and Sir Bartleby to come together in the first place. Sofia accepts and is then asked to keep the Wand until Tilly gives her a signal at the end of the ceremony. At the castle, Sofia, Amber, James, Queen Miranda, King Roland and his mother and sister are gathered in the throne room to be painted. While the adults stand in the back, the children stand in the front, with James as apparent heir to the throne in the middle. But suddenly, the Grand Queen remarks that it is Amber who should stand in James' spot. This confuses Roland because he always thought the firstborn son is heir to the throne, but his mother and older sister correct him: it is the first born child. Since Amber is seven minutes older than her twin brother that makes her the true heir to the throne. Roland still believes his mother and sister are wrong, so they go and look up in the scrolls in which the laws are written. As it turns out, the rulership on the kingdom shall be passed to the firstborn child. Roland is confused because his older sister Tilly would be Queen then. Tilly reveals that she was the Heir to the Throne and was offered the crown after Roland I, but she declined. She was more interested in becoming an adventurer and felt that Roland was more fit to rule. Roland is still confused by why nobody told him this. His mother reveals that it was always his wish to be king and it was all he is able to do. Amber is very happy because she is now going to be Queen, while James is angry and disappointed. He offends Amber by claiming that she is too self-centered to be a good and responsible Queen before storming out. Sofia follows James to the stables, where he is hitting his knight training dummy in anger. He was always raised to believe that he would be next in line to the throne and would be protecting the kingdom. Sofia remarks that this is not the only thing a King does and suggests finding another way of protecting Enchancia. This gives James an idea and leaves enthusiastically. He plans to show how he would be a better ruler than Amber. Meanwhile, Baileywick introduces Amber to her new duties as heir to the throne: greeting the guests, introducing the cake and holding on to Sir Bartleby's wedding ring until the wedding, which she immediately puts in her pocket. It is now time for Amber to greet the wedding guests. She knows every guest perfectly to James' dismay, as he had practiced them and could not remember. Sofia spots James spying on Amber and he tells her he wants to make sure everyone sees what a horrible Queen Amber would make. Sofia is shocked to hear that and tries to stop him. James runs to the gnomes and leads them to Amber as their greeting is very hard to recall. To his surprise, Amber still knows it and the one for the giants too. Sofia reminds her brother that Amber aced Majestic Formalities at Royal Prep due to being something Amber has always liked unlike him. James leaves, still disappointed. Tilly and her future husband appear and comment on how Amber has handled her duties. James overhears that, getting even more angry. Tilly shows her a cage of, to Amber's surprise, flying fish that she wants released at the ceremony. Sofia is asked to look after them but James interferes, telling Tilly to pass the job to Amber, which his aunt agrees with. James now thinks he has a chance to prove how unfit Amber is for the job. First, he distracts Sofia, showing her Wilbur the Wombeast has arrived and she goes to talk to her friend. After Sofia is gone, he distracts his twin sister too, telling her, her tiara is crooked. While Amber tries to correct that, he releases the fish. Sofia and Amber are horrified and try to catch them, in the process Amber touches the King of the Kobolds' hair. James remarks how Amber messed up and goes to help catch the fish too. As he comments on how Amber's dress is in danger of getting dirty, she surprises him again by replying she does not care. Two fish escape into the ocean. Sadly in her last attempt to get them back, Amber falls and the wedding ring Tilly gave her falls into the water. She is devastated and doubts her skills as future Queen of Enchancia. This leads her to declare James heir to the throne. Amber leaves heartbroken as Baileywick tells them the ceremony is starting, horrified at the prospect of telling her aunt she lost the ring. Despite achieving his goal, seeing his twin sister so miserable makes James start to feel guilty for his actions. James confesses to Sofia that he is the reason why the fish got out of the cage, much to her disappointment. She tells him to talk to Amber but he refuses as the ring is still missing. He wants to save it by using the Whenever-Wing-Wand. Sofia hands it to him and James fires magic at the ocean a few times even though Sofia warns him it could have dire consequences. After many shots, he finally hit the ring and it flies out of the water just as Baileywick reminds them of the ceremony. Just as they leave a giant octopus with wings, given by the wand, emerges out of the ocean. James hands the ring to Amber and tells her she is still heir to the throne. Suddenly, the giant octopus appears in the air, destroying the decorations and frightening the guests, who identify it as a kondraki. James notices it is his fault. Sofia is unable to hit it with the wand as it is moving to fast. Amber, still having lost her confidence, thinks she will not be of help. James confesses to his deeds, apologizing to his sister and finally gives in, as he observed how Amber enjoyed the stuff he always found boring. Amber gets her confidence back and sends Sofia to look after Tilly and Sir Bartleby, while she protects the guests. After Sofia has made sure Tilly and Sir Bartleby are not hurt, she notes the kondraki saying \"cake\", so she deduces he is after the wedding cake. She runs to tell her sister who commands the guards to protect it and get a small piece of it to lure the flying creature away. James takes it and Sofia uses the wand to give him wings to get the kondraki’s attention. Because he is not moving so fast anymore Sofia can finally hit him with the wand and get rid of its wings. The kondraki gets the piece of cake and falls into the sea. James gets praise for his bravery and Sofia notes how protecting the kingdom was always all he wanted, which he can do as a knight. James happily agrees, and Amber wants to declare her brother First Knight, only to be reminded by her grandmother that she is not Queen yet. In the end, Tilly and Sir Bartleby are finally declared husband and wife or adventurer and knight. Sofia uses the wand to give them and the guests wings and they all dance in the sky."

      "Tea for Too Many": " Today is the day a princess gets chosen to host the Royal Prep Tea Party. Sofia tells everyone that before she was a princess, she and her friends would spread blankets on the ground and borrow tea cups from their mothers. But Amber, Hildegard, and Clio tell her that the Tea Party is a big deal because the whole class goes including the Fairies, and they hosted bigger parties. When Sofia is chosen to host the next Royal Prep Tea Party, Hildegard and Clio tell her that she needs to do better than borrowed tea cups. At the castle, Sofia shows Amber and James that she wants to host one of the tea parties she used to have with Ruby and Jade, only this time, they get to use the castle tea cups and get to paint them. While James likes this idea, Amber doesn't because she thinks it's too small. She tells Sofia that she's her secret weapon for throwing a fabulous party, and she convinces her that bigger is better. Baileywick gives Sofia a planer to plan her party. Sofia decides on a swan themed tea party with swan shaped cookies and cakes. Ruby and Jade come over to have tea with her. She takes them to her hideaway: a secret garden. While the three of them have tea and biscuits, Sofia tells Ruby and Jade about the tea party for Royal Prep and wishing she could throw a party like the one she's having with them but feels she has to be considerate of her guests and Amber says her guests want a big and fancy party. Sofia is selecting the plates and wants the plain white plates but Amber takes over and picks the shiny gold ones. When Sofia is picking the goblets, Amber takes over again and picks the biggest ones. Sofia is starting to feel overwhelmed and says this is starting to look more like a feast instead of a tea party but Amber says you can never have too much of a good thing. When Amber finds out the size of the cookie samples after James ate them all, she insists that they be as big as possible which Sofia, out of consideration of her guests, reluctantly agrees to despite James's protests. Cedric agrees to make the tables float. Sofia asks the swans to help with her party and they agree. Amber decides to add a ice swan to the mix. Sofia is dismayed by how big Amber made her plan her party and James is annoyed that Amber didn't let Sofia make her own decisions. Sofia finishes by getting a new dress prepared for the party. The next day, Miranda comes out to see the party and notices how overwhelmed Sofia is. Suddenly, disaster strikes: The ice swan is accidentally sent into the swans pond. The spooked swans crash into Cedric, causing him to lose control of the floating tables, causing a mess and making them fly away. Sofia is upset because the party is ruined and she doesn't have time to plan another big party. Miranda asks her if she even wanted to throw a big party and Sofia says she didn't but only did so because she wanted to be considerate of her guests. Miranda tells Sofia that she's the host and it's what she wants that matters. Sofia decides to throw the party she wants in her hideaway and the guests declare it the best tea party they ever attended."

      "Baileywick's Day Off": " While Sofia's still sleeping, Baileywick cleans up her room and presents her with breakfast when she wakes up. She notes that he is in a particularly good mood and he tells her today is his birthday. Sofia wishes him happy birthday and asks if there will be a party but Baileywick says he doesn't need to have one since doing his job well is good enough for him. Sofia and everyone else in the castle sing a song praising Baileywick for being someone you can always count on. Baileywick announces that the kids' friends will be arriving shortly for their playdate and he will be on hand if they need anything. However, King Roland commands that he take the day off, since he always refuses. It also turns out that his brother Nigel has come to visit, and wants to spend the day doing all the fun things they used to do together as children: picking apples, eating ice cream and fishing. Zandar, Hildegard, Ruby and Jade arrive and everyone except Amber and Hildegard run off to go play pirates in James's treehouse. While getting ready to head out with his brother, Baileywick expresses uncertainty about not being around in case the kids need him, but Violet assures him they'll be fine. During the pirate game, James accidentally breaks a part of his treehouse and decides to ask Baileywick if he can fix it, since he hasn't left yet. Baileywick hears James calling him and goes to see what the matter is despite Nigel's protests. He uses his walking stick as a splint to keep the broken pieces of the treehouse together. Right after James's problem has been solved, Amber and Hildegard arrive to fetch everyone for the tea party. After Baileywick returns, Nigel says it's too late to go pick apples now but they can still go for ice cream. Although Amber's 'perfectly pink' tea party starts off well, she is horrified when she sees that the cookies have plaid-style frosting instead of pink like she wanted and screams for Baileywick. He and his annoyed brother arrive and Baileywick directs everyone to the kitchen, where the frosting is re-done exactly as Amber wants and she is much happier with the new cookies. Nigel says they've now missed out on picking apples and getting ice cream but Baileywick reminds him they can still go fishing. After the tea party, Sofia takes everyone to the garden to paint butterflies. Meanwhile, Baileywick and Nigel are waiting for their fishing boat to arrive, but Baileywick forgot his fishing pole back at the castle and leaves to go retrieve it. The kids start having trouble painting their butterflies - and in the case of James, a lizard - because they keep moving around, and James and Zandar scare off all the butterflies after trying to catch the lizard. Sofia calls for Baileywick, and so does Nigel from the dock, and Baileywick chooses to respond to Sofia. He catches the exact color butterflies that everyone asks for and even James's lizard, and places them inside a tent, making them easier to paint since they can't escape. Unfortunately, once Baileywick returns to the dock, the boat has already left. Nigel says they can fish right there at the dock, but a maid runs over to tell Baileywick it's time to start preparing the royal supper, so he and his dejected brother follow her back to castle. While the other kids bring in their paintings to dry, Sofia sees that Baileywick and Nigel have returned and asks how his day off went, but Baileywick tells her he and his brother never got around to doing anything they had planned since he spent all day helping her, James and Amber, but that was more important to him. While her mother takes her to go say goodbye to her friends, Sofia tells her about Baileywick having to spend his birthday solving everyone's problems and clearly feels guilty. Amber and James also feel guilty. While they are thinking of what to do before Baileywick's birthday is over, Sofia gets an idea and asks James to get some apples, and Amber to get ice cream (though she has a maid do it for her). Sofia also goes to get Nigel, just before he leaves. Finally, she brings Baileywick out to the treehouse, where the entire royal family and Nigel are waiting for him. There are even apples hanging from a nearby tree to pick, an ice cream cart, and since the treehouse is designed like a boat, Nigel jokingly brought their fishing poles. While Baileywick is flattered by everything they've done for him, he says they're missing the royal supper, but Sofia says he is more important."

      "Lord of the Rink": " At Royal Prep, the princesses are learning enchanted ice dancing from Flora. Amber, Maya, Clio and Lakshmi get it down in no time but Sofia is having trouble. Nearby, the princes are doing ice hockey practice with Sir Henley on the other side of the rink. To the annoyance of Amber and James, both the ice hockey team and the enchanted ice dance class have to share the rink. Hugo shows interest in the ice dancing class. Prince Derek takes advantage of Hugo's distraction to steal the puck but Hugo steals it back and scores. Meanwhile, Sofia attempts the Stargazer Spin but, because of her block, she slips and slides into the hockey net. After Hugo helps her up, Sir Henley decides the ice rink sharing idea is not working out and leaves with the boys. Hugo, however, stays behind after seeing that Sofia is still having trouble with her skating. She nearly falls again only for Hugo to catch her. Sofia notices how interested Hugo is and asks him if he would like to do it. Hugo refuses stating boys do not ice dance and Amber states that is because it's too hard for them. Hugo takes the challenge and, after Flora gives him some enchanted ice dancing skates, shows remarkable talent that wows Flora and the princesses. Flora asks him to join the class but Hugo refuses stating it is not for boys. Sofia assures him it is for anyone who wants to do it. Hugo points out there are no boys in the class but Sofia reminds him that there were no girls on the Flying Derby team until she joined due to her love for the Flying Derby, and encourages him to try the class and he agrees. The next day, Sofia informs Hugo of where they're having ice-dancing class. The other princes are shocked with Derek voicing it by asking \"You're doing ice dancing? Isn't that for girls?\" Hugo lies by denying it and then pulls Sofia aside and tells her he does not want his friends to know he is doing enchanted ice dancing because they might make fun of him. When Sofia reminds him that ice hockey practice is at the same time as enchanted ice dancing class, Hugo tells his friends he will not be coming to practice because he is sick. Flora takes Hugo and the princesses to the pond and freezes it solid, so the young royals can skate safely. Flora announces that a recital will be held. Hugo is worried until Flora states the recital will take place on Friday at the same time as his hockey practice, to his relief. Hugo and Sofia decide to do the recital together and, with Hugo's help, Sofia finally starts getting the more advanced moves down. He then invites her to his castle so they can keep practicing on the ice rink there. Upon arriving, Sofia is wowed by the rink and cannot wait to start practicing. Suddenly, Hugo's father King Garrick shows up. When he asks what they are doing, Hugo lies by saying they are practicing ice hockey. Garrick puts on Hugo's skates and decides to show Sofia his hockey skills with them, to Hugo's horror. The skates' magic kick in and make him do a flip that makes Garrick realize these are enchanted ice dancing skates. Hugo says there was a mix up with the skates, which relieves Garrick. For a moment, he thought his son was taking up enchanted ice dancing, and states that it is only for girls. Sofia tells him she knows some boys who ice dance (obviously referring to Hugo), but Garrick tells her that the boys in his family only play rugged sports. He wants to spend some quality time with his son, and Hugo agrees to do so after Sofia heads home. When Garrick goes back inside, Sofia tells Hugo he should tell his father the truth but Hugo cannot because he's afraid of his dad's reaction. The next day, Hugo and Sofia are walking to class and trying to think of the rest of their routine. Hugo is thinking of ending with the Spinning Dragon. Sofia claims that nobody in class can do that move with Hugo saying that they'll be the first. Suddenly, King Garrick shows up and tells Hugo he has found a way to spend more quality time with his son: He asked Sir Henley to make him the assistant coach for the ice hockey team so he can come to all of Hugo's practices, much to Hugo's horror. Sofia urges him to tell his father the truth but Hugo simply plans to switch back and forth between ice hockey practice and enchanted ice dancing class and do both. Sofia does not think it will work, but Hugo insists it will. He executes his plan and, so far, all goes well. After the final time, Hugo gets back in time to catch Sofia, who feels she will never get the fireball flip down. Hugo assures her he will not let her give up and, with his help, she finally gets it down. However, the other princes catch him in the act. Hugo tries to come up with a cover story but they don't buy it. At Sofia's urging, Hugo tells them the truth. To his surprise, James says that he's okay with Hugo ice-dancing because he knows that his younger sister went through this experience. Realizing there's nothing wrong with Hugo ice-dancing, the other boys tell him they are okay with it. Hugo is relieved, but he's still worried about his father's reaction, so his friends agree to tell Garrick that his son is sick and has to miss practice. Sofia assures him he can probably tell his father, but Hugo is still afraid of his father's reaction and insists on keeping it a secret. On the day of the recital, Hugo and Sofia are ready for the recital when Garrick shows up and escorts him to ice hockey practice. Sofia shows up and urges him to tell his father the truth by doing an ice dance. Hugo tries to stop her because people are staring at her. However, Sofia does not mind, stating \"I love ice dancing and I'm not going to let anyone stop me from doing what I love and neither should you.\" This convinces Hugo to finally tell his father the truth and he leaves with Sofia. Hugo arrives in a handsome blue tuxedo with Sofia who appears in a very pretty ballerina outfit. King Garrick, Sir Henley, and the other boys arrive in time to see Hugo and Sofia do the most spectacular duet at the recital. Sir Henley tells Garrick that Hugo is the best ice-dancer he's ever seen; he's even judged at least a dozen competitions. King Garrick tells Hugo how proud he is of him, and that he is only furious that he did not tell him the truth sooner. Garrick then asks Flora to make him the assistant coach for the enchanted ice dancing class, so he can still bond with his son. The rest of the hockey team are so impressed that they want Hugo to teach them how to ice-dance too, so Flora puts a spell on their hockey skates. Hugo and Sofia congratulate each other and notice that the other boys are having more trouble than she did, so they help the other boys learn how to ice dance."

      "Cedric Be Good": " Sofia and James are picking apples in the Royal Orchard to give to the villagers. When Cedric flies in on a flying machine, the pair ask him to let them ride it but he refuses. Cedric heads to his workshop with a flower from the Charmacy called the Alabaster Rose, a rare flower that blooms every one hundred years, to make a power plucking potion which he plans to use to make Sofia's amulet give him any power he wants after he steals it by switching it with a fake one he made. Back in the orchard, Wormwood distracts Sofia and Cedric casts a switching spell to switch the unaware Sofia's real amulet with the fake one. Suddenly while he is working on the potion, the amulet curses him with sticky hands. He tells his mother and he tries to get his hands out of the flask. The potion falls on the floor and gets destroyed. Winifred tells that Cedric has been cursed by the amulet because he stole it from Sofia. To break it, he needs to do a good deed. Winifred becomes his chaperone on the way out. Cedric hides the real amulet and gives Sofia his flying machine and the curse is broken. Cedric gives James another ride and asks to come with Sofia to the village after Winifred advises him to unlock the amulet's powers the same way Sofia does. Meanwhile, Wormwood distracts Sofia's animal friends by being \"friendly\" so they don't reveal to Sofia that she's not really wearing her Amulet. In the village, Cedric finally starts gaining the amulet's powers but he keeps getting them taken away by the amulet and getting cursed by it by doing bad deeds. He wants more powers so Winifred tells him to stop doing bad deeds and follow Sofia's lead. He asks Sofia to help him be a better person and she does. After helping a man finish building a house, Cedric finally gains the power he's longed for: Supreme strength. Afterwards, he and Sofia head back to the castle. Upon arriving back, Sofia discovers she can't use her powers and heads to Cedric. Meanwhile, Cedric's supreme strength gets taken away and he gets cursed with metal hands for destroying the king's throne. Back in his workshop, Winifred tells him to do the most noble kindhearted thing he can think of and, having had enough, Cedric returns the amulet to Sofia, restoring her powers, and breaking his curse. Sofia goes for a ride with James in Cedric's flying machine while Winifred tells Cedric that Sofia getting her amulet back is for the best. From that moment on, Cedric will no longer try to take over Enchancia with it."

      "New Genie on the Block": " Sofia is about to set out for the Kingdom of Tangu to practice her magic carpet dance with Zandar for the Museum Opening Party when a messenger mistakenly delivers a package for the Royal Family of Tangu. Sofia promises to take it to the Royal Palace of Tangu. On the way, the package starts to bounce around. Giving in to temptation, Sofia opens it and finds a lamp inside. Upon rubbing it, she accidentally releases a genie named Kazeem. Sofia asks him to get back in his lamp but the little genie refuses because he wants to have fun since he never been out of his lamp before. Kazeem takes off with Sofia in pursuit. In the marketplace, Kazeem grants everyone's wishes but ends up making a big mess when he grants a wish that turns a boy's toy elephants into real elephants. Sofia meets Madam Ubetcha again who tells her to go to the Genie Patrol and tells her where to find them. Sofia heads toward a big gold lamp and meets the Genie Patrol's only member Sergeant Fizz, who tells her about the Genie rules and the patrol's job of enforcing these rules and makes Sofia his partner. Together, the pair set out to find Kazeem and stop him. Meanwhile, Sofia's parents arrive at Tangu Palace to watch Sofia's rehearsal and provide a safety net (Roland's idea) and learn that Sofia hasn't shown up yet. Realizing something's wrong, Roland, Miranda, and Zandar take off on magic carpets to look for her, to Roland's discomfort since he's riding the same magic carpet Sofia rode on during her first visit to Tangu and it still has some of its spunk. Meanwhile, Sofia and Fizz intercept Kazeem at a birthday party but the young jinn refuses to listen and flies off. Sofia and Fizz give chase but Kazeem traps Fizz in the former's lamp, leaving Sofia to deal with Kazeem on her own since a jinn spell can only be undone by the Genie who cast it. At first, Sofia feels guilty for letting Kazeem out and feels like she's not up to the task but Fizz reminds her that now's not the time to play the blame game and assures her she can do it. Sofia resolves to stop Kazeem herself and sets off. Upon finding Kazeem, she gives chase all over Tangu. Meanwhile, Sofia's parents and Zandar bump into the flying camel Kazeem created. The bumpy ride this causes leads them to finding Sofia, who they pursue. The pursuit leads the quartet and Kazeem to Tangu Palace, where Kazeem sets monkeys loose and Sofia reunites with her parents and the magic carpet she rode during her first visit to Tangu. Sofia tells everyone what's going on and, with help from her parents, Sofia shows Kazeem how unhappy he's made everyone. Repentant, Kazeem grants Sofia's first two wishes: To let Fizz out of his lamp and undo his wishes. As a reward, Sofia uses her final wish to make Kazeem a member of the Genie Patrol, to his and Fizz's delight. Everyone celebrates with Sofia and Zandar's magic carpet dance."

      "Enchanted Science Fair": " The Fairies announce that it is time for the Royal Prep Enchanted Science Fair where the students will be paired up into teams and create some Enchanted Science Projects. The one who creates the best project will be awarded with the Enchanted Science Fair trophy. Amber is paired up with Desmond, Vivian is paired up with Khalid and Sofia is paired up with her brother James. When Amber, James and Sofia return home and ask their father for some Enchanted Science books, he happily obliges telling them how he always wanted to win with a Floating Solar System but always failed because it was too big a project for two people to finish. Amber and James both become very determined to win the trophy for their father which Sofia can see is going to lead to trouble. Vivian and Khalid decide on Glowing Glaze, Amber and Desmond decide on Lightning In A Bottle and James and Sofia decide on Forever Bubbles. They go to Cedric who gives them all the ingredients they need and soon begin work on their projects. So far all's going well, until Amber overuses the Hocus Crocus and destroys all three projects, forcing the three teams to start over. They go back to Cedric for new ingredients and he gives them everything they need except for the Hocus Crocus. This is because he doesn't have any more since they already took it all. He tells them the only place to get Hocus Crocus is at the top of Mist Bowl Mountain. He also tells them there's enough for only one of their projects but deliberately forgets to warn them about the ogre. Everyone takes off for the mountain and James and Sofia quickly take the lead and in order to maintain their lead, James deliberately drops carrots in front of the other carriages to slow them down. Sofia is shocked by her brother's actions against their friends and immediately protests that what he just did wasn't very nice but James ignores her as all he is focused on is getting the Hocus Crocus first so they can make the best project to win the trophy for their father. Everyone lands at the foot of the mountain and Sofia and James are the first to arrive at the Crystal Forest. Sofia takes a moment to admire the forest's beauty, but James shows no interest as he is still determined on getting the Hocus Crocus first. After noticing how fragile the trees are, Sofia urges him to walk quietly so they don't break them. Khalid and Vivian do the same thing but Amber and Desmond don't: they go charging through the forest way too loud and the trees crack, trapping the other two teams inside. Amber switches a sign to mislead the other two teams. Sofia and James arrive first and James switches the sign back. When they hit a dead end, they realize that Amber tricked them. The three teams reunite at the Musical Mist Geysers. Sofia realizes that the pattern of the geysers is a song and passes that knowledge to the others much to James's disapproval. Sofia and James regain the lead and arrive at the Ogre Gate where they meet the Ogre. The Ogre says they cannot pass him unless they solve his riddle which is \"What's more valuable than gold but doesn't cost a penny, it's hard to find but easy to lose.\" James believes that the answer is a sock as he loses socks all the time and never finds them, to which the Ogre and Sofia give him weird looks of shock and disbelief. Just as Vivian and Khalid arrive, Sofia comes up with the correct answer which is a friend, because a friend is worth more than gold but costs nothing and a good friend can be hard to find but a good friend is easy to lose when you don't treat them right. With the answer confirmed correct, the Ogre permits Sofia to pass but not the others since they didn't give the right answer. Sofia finds the Hocus Crocus but the wind blows it down the mountain as Amber and Desmond arrive. Khalid grabs it and runs off with it. Soon Amber, James and Khalid start to brawl with each other. Sofia tries to get them to stop fighting but, as usual, all three of them ignore her and keep fighting which causes them to lose the Hocus Crocus. After quietly returning to the castle, Sofia, at Miranda's urging, proposes they work together to make the Floating Solar System that Roland spoke about. However, nobody feels like working together as they are all still angry at each other for being mean to one another. Sofia encourages her siblings and friends to forgive each other and work together in creating the Floating Solar System. Thanks to Sofia, the young Royals apologize to each other and agree to the plan. On the day of the Enchanted Science Fair, they show the Floating Solar System and everyone is impressed. However, since they worked as a group of six, they are not declared the winners but Roland is more proud that his son and daughters were able to bring home the Floating Solar System he always wanted to make."

      "Ivy's True Colors": " Sofia is trying to serve a dish of veggies to Clover, but for some strange reason, he won't wake up. Mia, Robin and Whatnaught come in and ask Sofia what she is doing. She tells them she is trying to give Clover a snack but he will not wake up. Robin is shocked that Clover is not waking up for food and asks if she has been trying long. Sofia confirms that and asks her animal friends what is wrong since Clover normally wakes up for food. Robin tells her it is the Deep Sleeps an enchanted sleep that makes animals sleep for a long time. James comes in and tells Sofia that he cannot wake up Rex, to which Sofia says it might be because of the Deep Sleeps. She is also told that a fairy is working on a cure but has not found it yet. After James leaves to check on the horses, Sofia's Amulet starts glowing and she vanishes with Whatnaught, who is holding on to her. Seconds after Sofia and Whatnaught are gone, Mia and Robin get the Deep Sleeps as well, and they collapse, snoring. Sofia and Whatnaught reappear on a black and white island. Remembering the time she helped Princess Charlotte, Sofia realizes that her Amulet summoned her to help a Princess. The Princess in question is revealed to be Princess Ivy. They are on the island Ivy's sister banished her to. Ivy is not pleased to see Sofia again and asks if she came to see what the place she sent her to is like, to which Sofia reminds Ivy that her sister sent her here. Ivy is unmoved and tells Sofia she sent her back here to which Sofia retorts that she had to and reminds Ivy she was trying to take over Enchancia. When Ivy asks her why she is on her island, Sofia tells her she was sent to help a Princess. Ivy tells Sofia she does not want her help and that she is busy with her butterflies. A skunk named Roma tells Sofia that Ivy's butterflies are missing. Sofia insists on helping because that is what her Amulet sent her for and Ivy reluctantly concedes. Ivy has an enchanted butterfly net to trap them all. Sofia asks Whatnaught to look for the butterflies and the squirrel tells the Princesses that they are on the other side of the island. The Princesses head there. On the way, they run into a bear named Gruff. Ivy prepares to zap him with one of her dragonflies, but Sofia convinces him to move by getting him some Cake Fruit. When they arrive on the other side of the island, they find a meadow of colorful flowers, much to Ivy’s disgust. It turns out, her butterflies are pollinating the flowers, making them change color from black and white too. They are capable of being lured with the flowers so Sofia uses one and Ivy places her butterflies in the enchanted net. Ivy is surprisingly grateful, thanks Sofia and they attempt to leave each other respectfully. After Ivy leaves, Sofia thinks her work is done so she waits for her amulet to teleport her back, but she does not go. She finds Miss Nettle, searching through the meadow. Miss Nettle, still doing goods deeds, reveals she is the fairy looking for a cure for the Deep Sleeps. She tells Sofia she has created a flower to cure the Deep Sleeps: The Wake-Upsy Daisy. However, she needs the magic of Ivy's butterflies to make the Daisies grow. Sofia realizes her mistake of catching them, and why the butterflies came to the meadow. The Daisies all wilt and animals begin to fall victim to the Deep Sleeps, including Whatnaught. Sofia and Miss Nettle go off to convince Ivy to release the butterflies. Miss Nettle and Sofia arrive at Ivy's castle and ask her to release the butterflies, but Ivy refuses. So Sofia and Miss Nettle break in and set the butterflies free themselves (with help from Roma), and lead them back to the other side of the island. Soon enough, Ivy finds all her butterflies missing and realizes that Roma helped them, therefore she scolds him for betraying her. Just when Sofia and Miss Nettle arrive at the meadow, Ivy recaptures the butterflies, with help from Roma out of loyalty. However, Roma falls victim to the Deep Sleeps. Upset about her friend's condition, Ivy begins to cry. This is a feeling that she never had before. Sofia tells her it is because she cares about her only friend and the only way to cure the Deep Sleeps is if the butterflies pollinate the Daisies. Having a change of heart, Ivy frees the butterflies, who make the Wake-Upsy Daisies grow. The group uses the Daisies to wake up the animals. To Sofia's surprise, Ivy and Miss Nettle are now friends and they become partners to keep making the Wake-Upsy Daisies to cure all Deep Sleeps. Ivy also apologizes for her evilness and thanks Sofia for her help. Her new animal friends make her a throne. All Ivy wanted was a kingdom of her own, now she knows she had one all along, on her island prison. Sofia's Amulet teleports her and Whatnaught home where Sofia uses the Daisies to cure her animal friends. Mia, Robin and Clover finally awaken, while Clover smiles happily at the smell of veggies."

      "Cauldronation Day": " Sofia arrives by coach at Lucinda's house for her witch friend's Cauldronation Day. Lucinda gives Sofia her own witch outfit and then takes her down to her backyard where they set up for the party. As they set everything up, Sofia asks what a Cauldronation is and Lucinda explains that it is a ceremony where a witch proves she is ready to ascend from being a witchlet, a little witch, to a midnight witch, a big witch, by making a powerful magic broom called a Raven Catcher. Lucinda admits to Sofia that she is nervous both because making a Raven Catcher is a lot of work but also because she has to pick her witch of honor, a witch friend chosen to help her at the end of the ceremony. She has to choose between her two best witch friends Lily and Indigo, who do not get along because they are exact opposites: Lily is a good witch and Indigo is a wicked witch. Sofia promises to not let any quibbling on Lily and Indigo's part ruin Lucinda's Cauldronation because she wants it to go off without a hitch. Indigo, Lily, and the rest of Lucinda's witch friends arrive and Sofia quickly sees what Lucinda means when she says they do not get along before getting introduced to the two. Lucinda's mother comes out to begin the Cauldronation and takes pictures of Lucinda all the while. Lucinda begins the ceremony by lighting the Cauldronation Candles. The other witch kids go to pick the straw from the scarecrows nearby for Lucinda to make her Raven Catcher. To prevent further fighting, Sofia has Lily and Indigo work on different scarecrows. The attempt fails when Lily taunts Indigo. The infuriated Indigo hexes Lily's scarecrow, which attacks Lily and takes her straw. Indigo refuses to take the hex off until it almost ruins Lucinda's supplies. With the moon rising, Lucinda's mother announces it's time for The Broomstick Dance. To prevent another fight, Sofia has Lily and Indigo dance together. After the Dance is finished, Lucinda tries to cast the spell to make her Raven Catcher but Lily and Indigo distract her in a way that makes her mess up the spell. This makes her Raven Catcher crooked. Lucinda is upset about this but her mother tells her that she likes it. To prevent another hex-off between Lily and Indigo, Lucinda picks Sofia to be her witch of honor. Everyone is shocked since Sofia is not a witch but Lucinda's mother tells them it is not against any rules. Sofia and Lucinda start working on the potion for her Raven Catcher. This makes Indigo jealous and she hexes the Raven Catcher to get rid of Sofia. The hex causes the Raven Catcher to take off with Sofia on it. Lily tries to bring the Raven Catcher and Sofia back which causes another fight between her and Indigo. Their fight causes the Raven Catcher to go out of control. The broom finally crashes into the potion which makes it spill out and turn everyone, except Lucinda and Sofia, into owls. With her Cauldronation ruined, an upset Lucinda runs off. The transformed Lily and Indigo start bickering again but Sofia walks up and tells them straight that it was their fighting that ruined everything. This makes the two realize how selfish they have been and they tell Sofia the spell that will undo the mess. Sofia casts the spell and returns everyone to normal. Everyone then fixes everything. Sofia then brings Lucinda back where she successfully completes the ceremony to make her Raven Catcher. She and Sofia then fly off on it."

      "The Princess Prodigy": " At a music hall, bands from Westloch, Royal Prep, and the Junior Knights Academy are competing against each other in a battle of the bands known as the Band Showdown before a panel of judges composed of Flambeau the Talking Dragon, Crankle the Ogre, and, to the joy of Sofia and Vivian, Baron Von Rocha, the most famous Magical Musician in the Tri-Kingdom Area. Westloch has already taken their turn and the Junior Knights are currently up. Sofia notes that they are very good. The judges agree: Flambeau and Crankle both give the Junior Knights nines and Baron Von Rocha gives them an eight. Royal Prep takes their turn. Baron Von Rocha is impressed with them, especially with Vivian. Flambeau gives them an eight, Crankle gives them a seven, and Baron Von Rocha gives them a ten after messing it up the first time. The results are announced: Westloch has come in third place, Royal Prep has come in second, and the Junior Knights are in first place. Meanwhile, Baron Von Rocha is disturbed by the slip up he made and tells his songbird Piccolo he needs to replenish his magic and believes Vivian is the key. He walks up to Vivian and asks her if she would like to learn Magical Music from him. Vivian agrees if he will also teach the other members of the band too, to which Baron Von Rocha agrees. Merryweather is delighted and invites the Baron to the school so he can teach there. The next day, Baron Von Rocha arrives to teach the Royal Prep band Magical Music and musically explains how it works. To the surprise of the rest of the band, Baron Von Rocha moves Vivian up front and gives her a solo and devotes the entirety of the lesson to helping her get it down. Amber, James, and Khalid realize to their annoyance that Baron Von Rocha's only interested in teaching Vivian. Sofia sees Piccolo struggling to get out some music sheets and goes over to help him. After getting over the shock of her understanding him, Piccolo tells Sofia that he was a great singer until he lost his voice and that Baron Von Rocha's working on a spell to get his voice back. After the lesson is over, Vivian tells Baron Von Rocha that her friends feel left out and she does not want to hurt her friends' feelings. The Baron tells her to stop worrying as they are just holding her back and that her solo will ensure that Royal Prep will win in the next Band Showdown. He then tells her to just remember that she is the star to Vivian's delight. After Vivian leaves, Baron Von Rocha reveals that he made Vivian the star to drive away her \"annoying and talentless friends\" so she will focus on her solo, with which he plans to steal her musical talent- and that he is the reason Piccolo lost his voice. The next day at practice, Vivian starts acting very stuck-up towards her friends. Sofia tries to get her to stop being snooty by getting her to practice their special spin. However, at Baron Von Rocha's urging, Vivian snaps at Sofia, telling her that they are never doing the spin again, and that \"I don't have time to do silly dance moves with you,\" hurting Sofia's feelings. At Enchancia Castle, Sofia tells her mother what happened. Queen Miranda comforts her daughter and urges her to give Vivian another chance. The next day, Vivian reveals changes she has made to the band at Baron Von Rocha's urging: She has made the uniform Amber made her red so she will stand out more and the others are playing in the corner. This annoys Amber, James and Khalid to the point where they quit the band. Vivian voices her disbelief at what the three of them just did which prompts Sofia to tell her that she is being really selfish and a terrible friend. Shocked and hurt, Vivian asks Sofia if she is quitting too, which Sofia confirms because the band is not any fun anymore. Baron Von Rocha comes and has her play the solo, which magically transfers Vivian's musical talent to him. After Vivian leaves confused about her sudden inability to make music, Baron Von Rocha betrays Piccolo by refusing to give him his talent back, to which the angry bird steals the music sheet containing the spell and flies off to show it to Sofia. Piccolo finds Sofia and tells her what Baron Von Rocha did to Vivian and leads her to Vivian so she can see for herself. When she sees Vivian's state, Sofia asks Piccolo why Baron Von Rocha would do such a terrible thing to which the bird tells her that the Baron is a fraud who only has his skill for Magical Music because he did what he did to Vivian many times before and to many other people before her, including him. Piccolo also gives Sofia the music sheet containing the counter spell and tells her that if she plays it against Baron Von Rocha with a group she will overpower him and get Vivian's talent back. Sofia gets the band and together they confront the Baron. Merryweather comes in and, after learning what Von Rocha did to Vivian, helps the kids play the counter spell. They successfully play the counter spell and the talents Baron Von Rocha stole are restored to their rightful owners. Merryweather orders Baron Von Rocha to get out and he is sent packing. With her talent restored, Vivian apologizes to her friends for how she acted, they forgive her and the band is now back to how it was before. They play in the next Band Showdown together, happily reunited."

      "The Silent Knight": " In the Kingdom of Enchancia, all the knights in the Kingdom are gathered for the Shield of Valor Ceremony, an award that's given to someone for doing something very brave and the one getting it is Aunt Tilly who tamed the dreadful Dragon of Dashood and taught him how to knit. At this gathering, Sofia meets her favorite knight Sir Bartleby, also known as the Silent Knight since he never speaks in public. King Roland announces that it is time for the precession and so all the knights get to their horses. Tilly decides to go for a ride too and gallops around the fields facing backwards. But her ride is shortened when her horse suddenly halts to a stop nearly crashing into a man. The horse kicks her off, Aunt Tilly flies through the air and lands in the arms of Sir Bartleby. As the two look at each other, Sofia notices there is some sort of spark between them. However, Bartleby says nothing to her, he bows and quietly walks away. Curious to know, Sofia goes off to find out. Meanwhile, Roland is inspecting the knights' precession when he notices James riding along on a pony holding a sword and wearing a helmet. James tells his father he wants to be a knight but Roland tells him that becoming a knight takes years of training and James needs to be a squire first. James complains that a squire just follows the knight around and carries his stuff. Sir Finnegan tells James that a squire does much more than that and Roland tells him being a squire is a very important job and the first step to becoming a knight. So with that, James decides to be Sir Finnegan’s squire. Sofia finds Sir Bartleby and asks him if he likes her Aunt Tilly. Still, Bartleby won’t speak but after being asked many times he finally answers in a high squeaky voice “I love her!” Here it turns out he can talk but doesn’t like to, not with the voice he has which is why he’s too afraid to tell Tilly how he feels because he doesn’t know how she will react to the way he speaks. Sofia suggests he could write about how he feels rather than say it. Bartleby thinks that’s a good idea and begins writing a poem for Tilly while James starts to see how hard being a squire can be. Bartleby finishes his poem but he thinks it sounds silly. When they see Tilly and Miranda coming in their direction, Sofia encourages Bartleby to go to her and just as he’s about to a gust of wind catches his poem and flies away from him. Riding a shield and with Sofia following, they sled down the grassy hill after the poem where it lands in Roland’s hands who accidentally uses it as a tissue to sneeze on. Bartleby sadly walks to the hedges feeling hopeless. Sofia still feels he should still tell her but he still feels too embarrassed by his high pitch voice. When they hear Sir Maxwell singing this gives Bartleby an idea. He will pretend to sing while Maxwell sings from behind a bush. Sofia secretly doesn't think it’s a good idea but she still goes along with it. Meanwhile, James gets so fed up with being a squire that he decides to quit just as he passes Tilly. He feels that doing nothing but sharpening and polishing is boring. Tilly tells him that being a knight is about more than just riding a horse with a big sword and shield: it's also about being the first to head into dark creepy woods to see what’s lurking there, climbing the tops of icy peaks to battle snow monsters and that can’t all be done without a well saddled horse and clean armor. This makes James understand why Sir Finnegan is being so tough on him: He’s training him to be a knight at the same time. So he goes back and finishes off polishing Finnegan’s armor. Sofia shows up and escorts Tilly to the garden where Sir Bartleby is waiting for her. She tells her he will sing for her. Tilly is surprised by this and takes a seat on the porch. Sir Maxwell begins to sing Bartleby’s poem while Bartleby lip sings to her. Tilly is flattered by his song and really falls for him. However, just before the two can share a kiss Bartleby slips and accidentally reveals Maxwell singing from behind a bush. Realizing that it was not Bartleby singing, Tilly feels a little insulted and quietly walks away after Bartleby fails to give her an explanation. Seeing his friend down in the dumps, Maxwell decides to take Bartleby to do some fencing practice to take his mind off things. As Sofia watches Bartleby and Maxwell battle each other, she notices that some of Bartleby’s fighting skills look quite like dancing which gives her an idea. Meanwhile Roland finds James still polishing Finnegan’s armor. He tells him he should go and get ready for the banquet tonight but James says he’s not going because he has a lot of work to do. At the banquet Bartleby takes Tilly’s hand to dance. It goes very well until Bartleby bumps into a servant with some water. The water spills across the floor, Bartleby and Tilly slip, slide and then fall. Bartleby says he is sorry, but after realizing he spoke, he quickly rushes out of the ballroom with Sofia trying to catch up with him. Bartleby decides to give up and thinks he’s better off being alone. The next day, James quickly prepares Sir Finnegan for the ceremony, which finally earns him the knight's respect. Meanwhile, Sofia tries to encourage Bartleby not to give up and not to be afraid to be himself no matter how strange his voice sounds. At the ceremony, it is time to reward Tilly with the Shield of Valor. Sir Bartleby is given the honor to present the shield and although nervous he finally tells her how he feels, revealing his squeaky voice to the crowd. He admits the reason he didn't speak up in the first place was because he was worried about what she would think of his voice, but Tilly loves his voice as she loves one of a kind things. After being rewarded with the Shield of Valor, Tilly and Bartleby go off on an adventure to the Enchanted Forest together."

      "The Elf Situation": " At Enchancia Castle, Clover enters Sofia's room to find her. Sofia had been cleaning out her closet and found some toys she always loved playing with. The first she shows to Clover are Merlin's Blocks, magical blocks that makes anything one builds float in the air. According to Sofia, James used them to build a castle so big that it flew away and landed in the Kingdom of Freezenburg. She then takes out her Enchanted Jump Rope, a magical rope that twirls itself. Sofia demonstrates by jumping the rope while reciting \"Jumping, jumping all the time, Spell your name and make a rhyme, S-O-F-I-A, Glad I spelled it right today\". Clover tries to repeat it but trips on the rope. Embarrassed, Clover says the rope is defective. Sofia tells him not to feel bad as Amber jumped backwards into a fountain when she showed her how to use it. Sofia voices how she always had the best time playing with Amber and James, which she fears is now over now that they are going to attend their new schools soon. Clover tells her she should go play with her older siblings right now. Sofia agrees and goes to find them. When Sofia finds them, Amber is studying Diplomacy as she will need to know it when she is the Queen of Enchancia while James is practicing his Knight skills. Sofia shows Amber the Enchanted Jump Rope and asks her if she wants to play with it. Amber refuses, saying that she has grown out of it as being Heir to the Throne is a very grown-up job. So, she only does grown-up things now. Sofia then shows James the Merlin's Blocks and asks him if he wants to play with them. James also turns her offer down as he has to practice his Knight skills. Sofia notes they are really good, but James states that good is not enough if he is going to impress everyone at Chivalry Hall. Amber apologizes to Sofia and explains that she and James do not have time to play with her. Roland comes in with Baileywick, who has a cold. After sending Baileywick to bed, Roland explains that it is Royal Staff Day and he and Queen Miranda are taking them on a picnic to give them the day off. Because of this, he is leaving the three of them in charge of the Castle until they get back on the condition that they only get Baileywick if they need help. Roland also informs them that he has arranged a peace conference to resolve the Elf Situation once and for all so they can finally get a road built. After Roland leaves, Sofia is overjoyed since she sees this as a chance to play with her older siblings. However, Amber sees this as a chance to be Queenly and James sees this as a chance to be Knightly. Sofia insists that they play together since they will never get another chance like this again. The three of them then start playing together. Later, the three of them have put Merlin Blocks under a rug with a rope on it. Suddenly, Baileywick comes in with a note sent by messenger pigeon: The Royal Coach broke down so Roland will not be back in time for the peace conference. Baileywick offers to get everything ready for the conference but the kids send him back to bed as he still has his cold. They then go on their rug ride. Suddenly, Arielf, Queen of the Tree Elves, and Elfabelle, Queen of the River Elves, arrive for the peace conference. After Amber goes to get Roland's agenda, Sofia and James realize why their father has never been able to resolve the Elf Situation: Arielf and Elfabelle really do not like each other. When Amber gets back with the agenda, they lead them into the Dinning Room. Once at the dining room, they serve the two Elves food and lemonade. Amber leaves to ask Baileywick about a part of the agenda that she cannot make out, due to Roland's terrible handwriting. While she's gone, James and Sofia learn the reason for two Elf Queens' feud is because Elfabelle broke Arielf's great grandelf's best family dish by accident, and Arielf broke Elfabelle's great grandelf's family dish to get even due to thinking she did it on purpose. To get them to make peace, Sofia and James get them to start having fun together. Unfortunately, Amber shows up and ruins the fun by voicing the next part of the agenda: To air their grievances. Sofia and James try to stop her because they were having fun and the elves vouch for it, but Amber thinks there is no time for fun on duty and makes them say what bothers them. This makes the two Elves start fighting again and leave. Amber realizes her mistake. Sofia cuts her some slack because she was just following the agenda. Amber decides they can have fun. The trio go after them and finally resolve the Situation by getting them to play games together. The Elves finally make peace. When Roland gets back, he is pleased by what a great job they did."

      "Ghostly Gala": " It's Halloween in the Kingdom of Enchancia and Sofia is preparing the castle for a Halloween party. Suddenly, strange things begin to happen: Doors knocking with nobody there and candle lights blowing out by themselves. Sofia soon finds out the one responsible is a ghost known as Sir Reginald Daxter Sircliff IV (known simply as Sir Dax) who is trying to scare everyone out of the castle so he can host his Ghostly Gala, a party for all the ghosts in the Kingdom. Unfortunately, Sofia's party is on the same night as Sir Dax's Gala and she pleads with him not to ruin her party but he doesn't listen. Meanwhile, Clover meets a ghost bat named Boo who's a companion of Sir Dax. After Boo leaves, Sofia comes in and the two tell each other about their ghostly encounters. Sofia decides to use her parents' disbelief in ghosts to get all of Sir Dax's scares written off as party tricks she came up with. Clover finds Boo and gets him to have a snack with him somewhere secluded. Meanwhile, Sofia travels around the castle keeping an eye out for Sir Dax's tricks by asking the castle staff if they've seen anything strange, to which they answer no. When she gets to the ballroom, however, she hears her mother freaking out. Miranda tells her daughter that the xylophone is playing all by itself. Realizing that it must be the work of Sir Dax, Sofia intervenes and tells her mother that she had Cedric enchant the xylophone for the party and Miranda leaves convinced that it's a party trick. Sir Dax is annoyed that Sofia ruined his scare. Sofia tells him she won't let him ruin her party and continues to be vigilant against his scare attempts. She continues to ask the castle staff if they've seen anything strange and, like before, they normally answer no. But then, she hears her father screaming. Roland points out how his ties are flying around in the air all by themselves and tells Sofia to stay back. Sofia steps forward and again states that it's another one of her Haunted Castle surprises. An irritated Roland states that it's very entertaining, but asks her to keep the party tricks in the ballroom. Suddenly, the doors slam shut and when Roland asks what that was, Sofia nervously states it was just the wind and quickly leaves with a nervous giggle. Sofia runs down the hallway looking for signs of Sir Dax when he appears and tells her to stop ruining his scares. Unbeknownst to Sofia, James had been watching from the shadows and heard everything. As soon as Sir Dax vanishes, James runs up to Sofia and asks if that was a ghost. Sofia tries to claim it was just another party trick, but James sees through his little sister's excuses and proves his case beyond any reasonable doubt by stating that he saw her talking to it and demands that she tell him the truth. Realizing she's been caught, Sofia admits there are two real ghosts in the castle. James is actually excited about the prospect of having ghosts in the castle but warns Sofia that Amber better not see them because she said she'd make them move out of the castle. Meanwhile, Clover and Boo are having their snack when Sir Dax shows up. He reveals that the reason he has to have his Ghostly Gala tonight is because he can only have it on Halloween every 100 years and if he doesn't throw it, he won't see his family and friends for another century. Clover urges Sir Dax to talk to Sofia but, like with Sofia, he refuses to listen. Sir Dax and Boo both try to scare Amber but Sofia and James interfere and ruin his scare again. Pushed over the edge, Sir Dax has Boo bring bats into the castle but he can't get rid of them, thus ruining both his and Sofia's parties. Clover tells Sofia why he did what he did and, now feeling sorry for the ghost, she helps him get rid of the bats and together come up with a way for both of them to have their parties. Sir Dax and Sofia have their parties in the ballroom where everyone, except James, think the ghosts are all one of Sofia's party tricks."

      "Just One of the Princes": " Sofia and her family are going to watch a flying derby race. During the race, James tells Sofia that Royal Prep has its own flying derby team and that the try-out race is next week. After the race is finished, Sofia decides to go to the try-out practice at Royal Prep tomorrow. Sofia arrives at the tryouts the next day but, to everyone's shock, Sofia wants to try out for the Flying Derby team herself instead of just watching but is told that flying derby is not a \"princess thing\" though she believes it could be. After being encouraged by Clover, Sofia announces that she will try out for the team. While her parents and Baileywick are supportive, Amber and James on the other hand are not. Amber still insists that princesses shouldn't be derby racers, while James is only worried that his little sister will make him a laughing stock. When he points out that Sofia doesn't even know how to ride a horse much less about being a Flying Derby racer, his father suggests that James could teach her, and at the same time get in some much-needed practice himself. The next day, Sofia is ready to get a horse of her own and ends up with the one horse nobody wants, Minimus. Even though Minimus lacks self-confidence and has many faults, Sofia thinks he's perfect just the way he is. Unfortunately, she has trouble right from the start, and even with James's help, she is unable to even stay on her horse. However, Sofia refuses to give up trying out for the team and James vows to continue teaching her, even after they are mocked by Prince Hugo, the best rider in the school. Sofia and Minimus do well on most of the course, but are unable to tackle the final hurdle, which is to go through the top of the steeple. Later that night, Amber once again tries to discourage Sofia from racing, stating she almost crashed after failing to get through the steeple and she doesn't want her to get hurt. She then talks with her animal friends about what to do, and they say all she needs to do is get an early start so she can get more practice in. But even with extra practice, Sofia and Minimus still can't get through the steeple, for which Minimus blames himself. Hugo appears and tells Sofia there's no point in starting a race she can't finish, and she should go back where she belongs: with the other princesses. After Sofia comes home from school, her mother tells her that she and Roland will be going to watch the tryout race, but Sofia says she might not participate since she can't finish the course. Miranda tells her not to give up and that while she believes Sofia can make the team, what Sofia herself thinks is most important. On the day of the race, several people show up to see if a Princess can indeed make the team, which makes Sofia nervous but with support from James, she is ready to race. She starts out in last place but quickly makes progress. Hugo, deciding to take her out of the race, purposely brings his own horse to a sudden halt, taking Minimus by surprise and causing Sofia to fall off him much to the shock of Amber and the crowd. Amber angrily closes her fan and boos Hugo. Sofia almost decides to finally give up, but James appears and says he's not crossing the finish line without her. After helping her get back on her horse, the two of them catch up to Hugo and are soon at the steeple. Sofia and Minimus finally manage to go through it, and both Sofia and James get past Hugo, winning the race. The two of them are given Royal Prep's team jerseys and congratulated by their parents. Amber, who no longer likes Hugo because of what he'd done to Sofia, also admits that perhaps racing could be a princess thing after all, and gives Sofia her derby tiara to go with the jersey."

      "Blue_Ribbon_Bunny": " Sofia, Amber, and James are at a Village Fair, and learn that tomorrow there is going to be a Pet Contest: The grand prize is a blue ribbon for the pet that performs the best tricks and both the pet and its owner get to ride in a float in the fair parade. James plans to enter his baboon and Amber will be entering her peacock, but Sofia does not have a pet. James suggests she enter Clover, but Amber says a plain old bunny like him can't win and that Sofia should visit their castle's zoo and pick out a better pet. Back at the castle, after tossing some blueberries to Clover that he expertly catches in his mouth, Sofia tells him about the pet contest and that she wants him to enter it. Clover does not like being considered a 'pet', but Sofia assures him it will only be for the one day, and manages to change his mind after mentioning the blue ribbon prize and getting to ride the parade float. Clover then goes on to brag about being a 'blue ribbon bunny' through a rap number with the other animals and Sofia backing him up. Amber and James are practicing their pets' routines for the contest out in the garden when Sofia arrives with Clover. But when she tries to brush his fur to get the knots out, the annoyed Clover quickly leaves to go get a snack. Amber once again tells Sofia that Clover isn't going to cut it and that she needs an animal with a special talent. She takes Sofia to the castle zoo and introduces her to Ginger, a pretty white rabbit who can whistle, but Sofia still intends to take Clover. Hildegard and Vivian, who were told about the contest by Amber, come to visit along with their own pets, and Crackle is of course thrilled to see Clover. Zandar also arrives with his pet elephant. Sofia starts to become discouraged when she sees how talented everyone's pets are, and while Clover has a bit of a talent for dancing, she does not find his dancing very impressive. After finally getting the brushing done, Sofia tries to put a bow on Clover but he refuses to wear it, and then goes to dig for carrots again. Finally having lost all faith in him, Sofia tells him he doesn't have to enter the contest, and she can take Ginger instead. Although Clover is disappointed, he plays it cool and says he doesn't mind. Ginger agrees to go with Sofia and to Sofia's delight, likes wearing bows. Crackle stumbles upon the saddened Clover who tells her that he wants to go to the contest, but Sofia is taking another rabbit since apparently she doesn't think he's a 'blue ribbon bunny'. However, Ginger doesn't turn out to be quite what Sofia expected. Crackle angrily confronts Sofia about hurting Clover's feelings, revealing that he really wanted to go to the contest and only said otherwise to be nice. Sofia also encounters a boy who is entering his dog Max into the contest even though Max can't do any neat tricks, because they are best friends. This reminds Sofia of her own friendship with Clover and she decides to go back to the castle to get him, leaving Ginger with Baileywick. Sofia finds Clover by the fountain and tells him that no matter what anyone else says, he is a blue ribbon bunny to her because he's her best friend. Having reconciled, the two of them return to the contest. Crackle is performing her unicycle routine. After she finishes, Amber and her peacock Praline do a strut and pose together and Praline finishes with 'the shimmer'. Just as the contest is ending, the coach carrying Sofia and Clover lands onstage and they become last-minute participants. Clover breakdances and for the finale, he catches the blueberries that Sofia tosses at him in his mouth. Clover is declared the winner of the contest and receives the blue ribbon, and then he and Sofia board the parade float. Clover starts eating the flowers on the float because all the waving is making him hungry, but Sofia tells him to stop and says that later she will have the castle chefs make a feast for her 'blue ribbon bunny'."

      "Return to Merroway Cove": " Sofia and her family are visiting Merroway Cove. King Roland tries to go fishing, but has some issues with the fishing rod, while Sofia wants to meet Oona. Her father tells her to be back when the water show that Queen Emmaline prepared starts in the evening, to which Sofia promises. Sofia turns into a mermaid herself and dives into the water to search for her mermaid friend. She finds her and the others practicing for the water show. While everyone shows great tricks, Oona is only allowed to use her magical comb to conjure up a few little waves. Sofia greets everyone and comments on the fountain Cora made. Meanwhile, Oona is disappointed because her waves were barely noticeable. She tries to persuade her mother into teaching her more skills, but Emmaline denies her request, stating she is still too young for such a thing and will teach her when she is old enough. After Cora tells her sister the fountain she will make will be the star of the show, Oona gets angry and swims away, expressing how everyone treats her like a little kid unable to handle such a magical artifact. So, she tries to create a small sea twister. Oona succeeds, but the twister gets too big and is soon out of her control and it swirls away. Fearing that her mom will be furious if she finds out about her careless mistake, Oona follows the twister. Meanwhile, Sofia has decided to search for her friend. She swims inside a cave, but gets startled by a Scare-Acuda. Another Protector, a mermaid named Nerissa, appears and catches the fish. Nerissa recognizes Sofia and tells her she trained together with Chrysta. Nerissa sends the Scare-Acuda home to the north end of the cove. Nerissa explains to Sofia the reason why she is in Merroway Cove: To find Ursula's Necklace, one of the Wicked Nine which is hidden in the Kelp Forest. Nerissa leaves, heading to the hiding place of the Wicked Nine item she is searching for. Oona, still searching for her missing sea twister, swims into Sofia and asks her if she had seen it. Sofia notices something is wrong and Oona confesses her mistake. Sofia suggests to tell Queen Emmaline, but Oona tells her not to worry because she is afraid of the consequences she might face if her mother finds out. So, she pleads Sofia to help her find the sea twister. Now, Sven arrives, wanting to inform Oona about the sea twister which has gone wild, but Oona tells him she already knows about it because it is her fault. The seahorse makes the same suggestion as Sofia did earlier, but Oona dismisses him again, saying she is able to stop it herself. Sofia, Oona and Sven swim towards the Kelp Forest, where the sea twister was last seen, only to discover the twister has moved on. While following the path of destruction the twister left behind, they help some sea creatures in need, one of them being an octopus named Octavio who was saved by Nerissa, but has seen her being dragged away by the rampaging sea twister with her Enchantlet left behind. Octavio leads them to the Stormy Shipwreck where the twister went. The group finds Nerissa trapped underneath the fallen mast of the sunken ship. Sofia frees her by binding the Enchantlets together as only one of them is not strong enough. After Nerissa is freed, they continue their search for the sea twister. Nerissa also tells them that Ursula's necklace has been carried away by the twister. When they discover the twister, Oona follows it very closely. Sven notices the chest which contains the necklace in the eye of the twister. Now, Oona tries to get the sea twister to go away, but her yelling \"Go!\" with the Mermaid Comb in her hands only leads to the twister growing in size until she cannot swim against the current any longer. Nerissa saves her, but Sofia and Sven are pulled into the twister. While the Princess manages to get the necklace out of the chest, she is unable to free herself from the twister. Nerissa pulls her out again by binding the Enchantlets together again. After Sofia is free, they notice that the twister is moving towards the palace. Oona finally agrees to get her mother. While Oona swims as fast as she can to get her mother, Nerissa and Sofia attempt to slow down the twister with some rocks. Oona arrives at the palace, but her mother isn't there, only her sister Cora. Sven tells Cora what happened. At first, Cora is angry at Oona, who tells her how she just wanted to impress the others at the show. She is sorry about that, but soon suggests using the trident to stop the twister without help from Queen Emmaline to cover up Oona's deed, even though she has only seen her mother use it. Sven is worried about that Cora cannot control the trident and leaves. Oona and Cora swim towards the sea twister with the trident but cannot stop it as every shot they fire at it misses. Sofia and Nerissa's attempt to stop it with some heavy rocks has also failed. Suddenly, Queen Emmaline arrives and stops the rampaging sea twister with the trident. As it turns out, Sven got her to help. Nerissa thanks Sofia for getting the necklace and leaves to take it to the Mystic Isles. Emmaline, on the other hand, is angry with her daughters for using the trident and the comb without permission and confines them to the Palace. But because they apologized and told the truth in the end, she allows them to take part in the show after all and announces the start of their punishment for tomorrow. Now it is time for the show, Sofia arrives in time and they all enjoy the show together. As it turns out, Roland only caught a long nap while he was fishing."

      "Hexley Hall": " Sofia is in her room at Enchancia Castle playing \"Clover Says\" with Clover. While playing, Sofia states \"I wish I were a rabbit\" and she suddenly turns into one, to hers and Clover's shock. Sofia deduces that her Amulet gave her the power to transform into animals. After she changes back, Sofia confides in Clover how, ever since she freed Princess Elena from it, her Amulet has been acting differently and goes to see Cedric. Cedric is in his workshop making an Enchanted Painting of Hexley Hall when he accidentally gets Wormwood trapped inside it. Sofia comes in and helps Cedric get Wormwood out before discussing to him about the events in Avalor and how the Amulet has been acting different. At Wormwood's suggestion, Cedric decides to take her to Hexley Hall. Cedric confides to Wormwood how he is taking her there so he can learn all the Amulet's secrets and then take it for himself. Sofia, Cedric, and Wormwood arrive at Hexley Hall. On the way inside, Sofia notes that Wormwood has been complaining about Cedric nonstop and asks him what is going on to which he tells her that it is because he is a buffoon who embarrasses him nonstop. Sofia tells him that Cedric never says a bad thing about him to which Wormwood retorts \"Why would he? I'm perfect.\" Upon getting inside, Sofia notes how Hexley Hall is like Royal Prep to which Cedric adds \"Only better. Much better.\" They meet up with Grimtrix the Good, the Headmaster of Hexley Hall. When Grimtrix asks why they have come Cedric lies by stating he is helping Sofia with a homework assignment for Alchemy Class by bringing her to the library. Wormwood notes that anyone can tell he is lying. Grimtrix's weasel, Wriggley suddenly appears and invites him to lunch with the other familiars in the conjiteria to which he agrees before going with Sofia and Cedric to Hexley Hall's library. Once there, Sofia and Cedric find a book that reveals that the Amulet of Avalor was made in the Kingdom of Maru. Cedric tells Sofia that since she has freed Elena from the Amulet she is now in control of the powers of the Amulet which the book says is unbelievable. During an experiment Sofia learns that she must see the animal she wants to transform into in order to activate her animal transformation power. Wriggley comes in and escorts Wormwood to the congruities where the other familiars mock him for having such a poor master and brag about how great their masters are. To make them be quiet, Wormwood tells them that Sofia has the Amulet of Avalor. This proves to be a mistake as this makes Wriggley, Pumpkin, and Chester decide to steal it for their masters. Realizing his mistake, Wormwood goes to warn Sofia. Wormwood finds Sofia in the library and warns Sofia that the other familiars are after her Amulet. Wriggley, Pumpkin, and Chester appear and try to steal the Amulet. Sofia, Wormwood, and Cedric flee to the Potion Room where Cedric accidentally spills a Floating Potion on himself and a Speaking Potion on Wormwood. Sofia deduces that Wormwood told them about her Amulet. Cedric decides they have leave immediately. On the way out, Wriggley steals the Amulet and escapes. Sofia is so angry that she blurts out to Cedric that Wormwood was the one who told them about her Amulet. Cedric asks Wormwood, who he can now understand, if that is true and Wormwood admits it is. Angry and feeling betrayed, Cedric tells Wormwood that they are finished and leaves to help Sofia get her Amulet back. They pursue Wriggley to the Wandetorium. Sofia helps Cedric by handing him the wands in the room. Wormwood appears and makes Wriggley stand still long enough for Cedric to zap her with the Stand Still Wand. Sofia gets her Amulet back and Cedric reconciles with Wormwood. Grimtrix appears and reveals that he knew about the Amulet of Avalor all along and is after it so he can use it to take over a kingdom. He then tries to steal the Amulet with his crystal ball. Sofia overcomes the pull by using the Amulet to turn herself into a bulldog. The reversal causes Grimtrix's Crystal Ball to get destroyed. The trio then escape using the Floating Potion. They then get into the coach and go home."

      "Cool Hand Fluke": " In the underwater Kingdom of Merroway Cove, Oona is playing with the other merkids: Fluke, Shelly, and Flip. Suddenly, the Floating Palace appears at the surface, to Oona's delight since this means Sofia's back which Sven is delighted to hear. On the surface, the Royal Family of Enchancia is relaxing on the island in the cove when Sofia gets the idea to throw a party for the Merpeople and runs off so nobody can see her transform into a mermaid. After doing so, Sofia happily reunites with Oona and Sven and tells them about the party. After Sven sends his family back to the colony with the news, Oona takes Sofia to meet her friends who are all delighted to meet her because of her heroics during her last visit, which makes the egotistical Fluke jealous. Oona comes up with the idea to sing a song for Sofia's family as a gift which Fluke rudely dismisses as a poor gift. He spots a giant clam and decides to get a pearl as a gift but gets himself stuck in its shell prompting his puffer fish friend, Slim, to get help. Meanwhile, the merkids are playing their song for Sofia when Slim arrives and tells them what happened. Sofia gets him out which Fluke is ungrateful for and is uncaring that Flip's mantacorn horn was broken during the attempt. When Sofia asks what that is, Oona and Sven tell her a mantacorn is a manta ray that has a sharp horn growing out of it's forehead which it sheds every year and stores in a cave. Fluke decides to get one of the mantacorn's old horns despite everyone telling him that's a bad idea since mantacorns are dangerous. Sofia, Oona, Slim, and a reluctant Sven, since mantacorns eat sea horses, go with him. Fluke's recklessness gets them trapped in the cave which makes Oona very angry at him prompting a guilt-ridden Fluke to admit that he was jealous of Sofia because the others were paying more attention to her instead of him because of the time she saved Oona. Fluke makes up for his behavior by getting the horn they came for and trapping the mantacorn in the sea weed patch. Sofia tells the manticorn why they needed one of his old horns and gets him unstuck. The mantacorn tells them they can just ask him for his old horns because he's a music lover and reveals that his kind eat puffer fish not sea horses. Later, the merpeople arrive at the surface for the party where the merband, the Mertones, play their song."

      "Scrambled Pets": " Sofia, James, Amber, and their friend Vivian are in the play area, playing with their pets: Clover, Freedo, Praline, and Crackle. While playing fetch, Freedo keeps bumping into Praline, much to the peacock's annoyance. Amber tries to comfort Praline by giving him some apple slices only to find them all gone because Clover took them and is eating them while he and Crackle are playing on the seesaw. After Freedo bumps into Praline once again and knocks Clover and Crackle off the seesaw, Amber complains to James that his baboon keeps bumping into all the other pets but James defends him by stating the playground is too small. Amber agrees with him and thinks they should bring their pets to the playground at Royal Prep. James and Vivian both think it's a good idea but Sofia doesn't because bringing pets to school is against the rules. However, after being persuaded by James, Amber, and Vivian she joins in on their plan, despite her misgivings about it. The next day, the quartet sneak their pets in and so far all goes well. In sorcery class, Professor Popov is serving as a substitute teacher because the Three Good Fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, are giving a new student, Princess Zooey, and her mother, Queen Avery, a tour of the school. He teaches the class how to make the mix-up potion, a potion that mixes up any two things, which he demonstrates on an apple and an orange. All the apples and oranges attract the attention of Clover and Praline. Luckily, Popov doesn't see them and hands everyone what they need for the potion. Just then, Popov is informed that the magic tap shoes have gotten loose again and leaves to take care of it. Sofia's misgivings resurface because he almost saw the pets but Amber tells her to relax and that there's nothing to worry about. But Sofia's misgivings soon become a frightening reality when James drops an apple that catches Praline's attention and he goes after it, revealing himself to the class. Soon, Clover and Freedo come out of hiding to help themselves to the fruit and Crackle comes out and tries to stop them and the ruckus they make causes the potion to spill on them. Clover is mixed up with Crackle and Praline is mixed up with Freedo, much to the peacock's dismay. Things soon get worse when Freedo sees a ball and feels the urge to fetch it and Praline goes after him. The kids decide to get their pets back before the teachers see them. Before leaving, Sofia apologizes to Clover and Crackle and promises to fix everything as soon as they catch Praline and Freedo. After the quartet leave, Clover and Crackle decide to go look for Freedo and Praline themselves but at the same time struggle with being each other. While Sofia, James, Amber, and Vivian are out on the school grounds looking for their pets, the Fairies are nearby showing Princess Zooey and Queen Avery around Royal Prep. Meanwhile, Clover and Crackle are still struggling with being each other and they gain a better understanding of each other because of this. The kids find Praline and Freedo and head back only to find Clover and Crackle gone. Sofia is ready to go to the teachers and confess but Amber tells her they can handle this themselves which James and Vivian agree to because they don't want to get in trouble. Amber and James try to get Freedo back to normal but only succeed in making him a giant with an enlargement potion. Meanwhile, Sofia and Vivian find Clover and Crackle and get back just in time to discover what James and Amber had done. Freedo heads towards the gym leading the fairies to discover the scrambled pets. The fairies demand an explanation and Sofia tells them what they did and what happened. The fairies are disappointed but give the kids the antidotes to the two potions. After a struggle with Freedo, the four pets are returned to normal, Popov also finally catches the magic tap shoes and Zooey agrees to enroll at Royal Prep. On the way home, Sofia apologizes to Clover for what happened and Clover tells her it wasn't so bad. Crackle also admits it was great fun being half rabbit and, after stating they should do it again, she holds up a vial of mix-up potion. Sofia and the other animals all scream a resounding \"NO!\" except Freedo who squeals a resounding \"YES!\" with delight. The other three animals leap on Crackle causing her to drop the vial and spill the potion on themselves, resulting in them getting mixed up once again."

      "The Mystic Isles The Falcon's Eye": " Chrysta is teaching Sofia how to use the Necessi-Key, a magical key that can be used to make a magical door wherever and whenever it's user wants, however it only lasts for a few seconds. Meanwhile back at the Protectors' Castle in the Mystic Isles, Prisma is lamenting inside her cell about how she cannot escape despite the fact that the Locket of Vor (whose magic Prisma believes will be the key to her freedom) is right in front of her because she cannot reach the locket due to it being stored in a strong vault facing yards across from her cell. Suddenly, a rat named Twitch appears before her and reveals that he is a strangling, a shapeshifter, which he proves by using his powers. Prisma asks Twitch to retrieve the Locket and gives him instructions to pick the crystal lock. Twitch does as Prisma instructs and gets her the Locket. Prisma thanks Twitch and promise to share whatever power the Locket gives her. She then puts the Locket on and opens it, releasing a spirit trapped inside. The spirit is happy to be free and asks what powerful creature freed her, to which Prisma reveals that it was her. The spirit knows Prisma has no power, to which Prisma reveals that is why she needs her power to break free. The Spirit reveals that the only power it can give is the Power of Knowledge and tells Prisma she knows where she can find the Wicked Nine, nine magical objects hidden throughout both the Mystic Isles and the EverRealm that belonged to history's most devious villains such as Jafar's Snake Staff and Ursula's Necklace. The Spirit tells Prisma that if she gathers all nine objects and brings them to her she will use their power to restore her own. After Prisma remembers she cannot get out, Twitch offers to retrieve them for her since he has always wanted a powerful master and has picked Prisma. The Spirit tells him the first of the Wicked Nine he needs to find is the Falcon's Eye, a magical jewel that is hidden under the hilt of the Sword of Shan Yu, in a marketplace in Wei-Ling. After Twitch leaves to get it, two of the Protectors come in and discover that the Locket of Vor has been stolen and alert the other Protectors. Vega contacts Sofia and Chrysta and informs them of the theft, and how the Wicked Nine are being sought out by the thief. After Chrysta explains to Sofia what they are, Vega explains to Sofia the danger of the Wicked Nine being brought together and dispatches the pair to Wei-Ling to protect the Falcon's Eye. The pair arrives in Wei-Ling on the Kingdom's Market Day. When they find the sword, they decide to set a trap for the thief. Jin and Jun show up and Sofia decides to tell them what is going on. Chrysta, however, is against getting them involved and insists that they are left out of it on the grounds that it is Protector business. After Jin and Jun leave, they watch one of Kai's dances before finding a place to watch the trap. When Kai dances in front of the spot, Chrysta orders Sofia to make him leave, which she politely does. Twitch tries to get the sword and falls into the trap. He turns himself into a skunk before Sofia and Chrysta arrive, causing them to dismiss it as a false alarm. Chrysta tells Sofia that the thief is probably a bad guy wearing the locket. Hearing this, Twitch drops a bunch of lockets on the ground to create a distraction. A man picks up one of the lockets and puts it on. When they see the man, Sofia and Chrysta assume he is the thief only to discover it is Emperor Quon. Meanwhile, Twitch steals the Falcon's Eye. He then turns himself into a bat and flies away. Meanwhile, Sofia and Chrysta realize they were distracted and find the Falcon's Eye gone. Kai, who witnessed the theft, tells them what he saw. Chrysta deduces that the thief is a strangling which she declares will be difficult to catch. She is unhappy with Kai not warning them, but he says he did not know they need to catch a thief and it is understandable because Chrysta ordered Sofia not to ask anyone else for help. This makes Chrysta realizes that just because she is the trainer, she does not always know best so Sofia comes up with a plan and brings in Jin and Jun to help and the group chases Twitch all over Wei-Ling. They corner him at a wall, which he goes through a hole. After going through the wall with her Necessi-Key, Sofia successfully retrieves the Falcon's Eye, but Twitch steals Sofia's Necessi-Key and escapes. Sofia and Chrysta take the Falcon's Eye back to the Mystic Isles to give it to the other Protectors for safekeeping. Meanwhile, Twitch delivers the Necessi-Key to Prisma, who uses it to break free and escape. When they get back, Sofia and Chrysta learn about Prisma's escape and how she is behind the thefts. Sofia proposes bringing as many of the Wicked Nine back to the Protectors' Castle for safekeeping. Vega agrees and dispatches the other Protectors to do that. Meanwhile, Prisma is making her next move to regain her powers and get her revenge."

      "All_the_Sprite_Moves": " At Zumaria Castle, the Royal Family of Zumaria are getting ready to move to a new and larger castle. Vivian's parents are completely thrilled about the new castle since it has a swimmer's moat, a three carriage garage, a jousting court, and an enchanting garden. However, Vivian confides in Sofia that she does not want to move because it means she has to leave her music room, her favorite place in the world, behind. To cheer her up, Sofia invites Vivian to Enchancia Castle for dinner, which Vivian agrees to. Upon arriving, Sofia, Vivian, and Crackle look for Clover. They find him in the garden giving the Wee Sprites a ride on \"The Clover Express\". Crackle runs up to Clover and, as usual, smothers him with affection. Sofia introduces Vivian to the Sprites. She also tells her about the time she met them. This proves to be a mistake because, after Sofia leaves to go to dinner after being told it is ready, Vivian asks the Sprites to help her sabotage her family's move by making it seem like the new castle is haunted, which they agree to do. The next day, Sofia, the pets, and the Royal Family of Zumaria arrive at the new castle. After everyone gets inside, Vivian sneaks the Sprites into the castle, where they begin causing trouble. Vivian pretends to take this as a sign that the castle is haunted but her parents insists there is nothing strange going on and they keep unpacking. Vivian tells the Sprites to do bigger stuff before leaving with Sofia to see her new room. Meanwhile, Crackle takes Clover to the garden where they meet a hedgehog named Herb who's the Grand Poohbah of the garden which he reveals is an enchanted garden. Clover eats a berry that Herb reveals is an Enchanted Liking Berry which makes you go gaga over the first living creature the eater sees. The Liking Berry's effects make Clover fall head over heels for Crackle to the point where he serenades her, which eventually starts to creep Crackle out. Sofia and Vivian arrives in Vivian's new room and Sofia states it's got stuff Vivian would love. Vivian admits that it is great but she still misses her old music room. Suddenly they hear a crash and go see what it is. Upon meeting up with her parents, Vivian insists that it must be the \"ghosts\" again. Sofia spots something in the clock and, while nobody is looking, uses her shrinking ability to get inside. Inside, she finds her Wee Sprite friends who tell her Vivian brought them into the castle to sabotage her family's move, to Sofia's horror. Back in the garden, a fed up Crackle asks Herb if there is a berry that will undo the effects of the Liking Berry and he tells her there is: A Blues Berry. But he can not remember where the Blues Berry bush is. Meanwhile, Sofia gets out of the clock and returns to her normal size and confronts Vivian who admits that she brought the Sprites in to sabotage the move. Sofia tells her that letting the Sprites in was a big mistake because once you let Wee Sprites in, it is almost impossible to get them out. Sofia understands Vivian's feelings, as she felt the same way when she and her mother moved into their castle: For her, it was sad because when she moved she had to leave behind many of the things she loved such as her room, her house, and her friends. It was also scary because everything was new and different. But Sofia also points out that just because something is new doesn't mean it can not be great. Suddenly, Crackle arrives with a clingy Clover and asks her for help. Sofia and Vivian follow her to the garden. All the plants make Vivian like the garden and admit she likes her new room too. Meanwhile, Crackle finds the Blues Berries and uses them to return Clover to normal. Meanwhile, Vivian and Sofia meet up with Vivian's parents who are now convinced that the castle is haunted and want to move back to their old castle. Vivian admits that it is actually Wee Sprites but her parents are unmoved with King Marcus telling her having Wee Sprites in the castle is worse than having ghosts in it. Vivian asks the sprites to leave but they refuse. Sofia explains that to get Wee Sprites out she has to make them say they want to leave, which they never want to do. Crackle runs up to Sofia and tells her she got Clover back to normal which gives Sofia an idea. Vivian gives the sprites Liking Berries which make them fall for Sofia. Sofia asks them to leave the castle with her and the smitten sprites say they want to leave, which gets them out. Vivian tells her parents who are pleased and she apologizes for her actions. Her parents understand how she feels as they too had to leave behind the stuff they loved. Once in the garden, Sofia returns the sprites to normal with Blues Berries. The Royal Family of Zumaria arrive in the garden which Vivian declares her new favorite place in the whole world and everyone has a garden party to celebrate."

      "The Emerald Key": " On a ship sailing across the sea on a stormy night, a cloaked woman heads to the stern and opens a small container and finds a glowing key she plans to use to take over the Kingdom of Hakalo. A young girl named Lani tries to stop her but both end up falling overboard with the key. Lani cries for help but no one notices her as she floats out to sea. At the same time, the Royal Family of Enchancia are spending the day at the beach, when Roland notices a storm coming. Miranda tells the kids they're going home and as everyone packs up, Sofia finds the key and shows it to her family. She asks her parents if it's magical and Roland states they'll find out when they get back to the castle. Meanwhile, the woman who tried to steal the key is watching from tall grass and decides to trick them into giving her the key and uses a magical jewel to disguise herself, revealing that she's a sorceress. Meanwhile, back at the castle, Sofia discovers the key she found is known as the Emerald Key, a magical key that leads whoever possesses it to the island Kingdom of Hakalo. Baileywick comes in and announces that they have a visitor: the Princess of Hakalo. After being introduced, Lani tells Sofia and her family how she came to the castle and asks for the Key to be returned to her. Suddenly, a green-eyed girl comes in claiming she's the real Princess of Hakalo. Amber insists that the second Lei-Lani is the real Princess of Hakalo since she has a classical princess look but Sofia knows that appearances can be deceiving and insists that the two girls be tested. Roland agrees to test them with three challenges. For the first challenge, the two girls are expected to dance gracefully. Princess Look Lei-Lani wins only because she danced a waltz. For the second challenge, the two girls are required to gracefully accept a gift. Lani wins because Princess Look Lei-Lani throws a tantrum after discovering that her gift is a snail. Since it's still raining, Roland decides that the third challenge will be held tomorrow morning. Sofia spends some time with Lani, who tells her what being a true Princess is all about and Sofia agrees. Sofia now knows that Lani is the real Princess but Lani reminds her that she still has to prove it to her family. Meanwhile, Princess Look Lei-Lani reveals that she is in fact the sorceress who tried to steal the key in disguise and makes Lani's bed lumpy to ensure she fails the final challenge. The next morning, Lani comes out of her room, bone tired. The third challenge is to see which girl can make it out of the maze first. Princess Look Lei-Lani wins because of her cheating and gains the Emerald Key, upsetting Lani. Sofia points out that Lani only failed because she didn't sleep well. Amber insists that she must not be used to sleeping in a castle but Sofia suspects foul play. Sure enough, Sofia discovers that the reason Lani didn't sleep well is because her bed was lumpy and finds Princess Look Lei-Lani's ring under the mattress, proving she made the bed lumpy. Since a true princess would never cheat, this discovery forces the Royal Family to realize that Lani was telling the truth all along. They go after Princess Look Lei-Lani who drops her disguise and Lani identifies the sorceress as the one who tried to steal the Emerald Key. The sorceress tells the Royals she is Mamanu the former Royal Enchantress of Hakalo who Lani's father banished from Hakalo for stealing magic crystals from the Royal Museam and that she wants the Emerald Key so she can take over Hakalo and have her revenge on Lani's family. The forest animals stop Mamanu from escaping and Lani gets the Key back. Mamanu demands the key back. Sofia and her family shield Lani but before the guards can seize Mamanu, she escapes. Later on, Lani is reunited with her family and after saying their good-byes, the Royal Family of Hakalo use the Emerald Key to return home."

      "The Shy Princess": " During Art Class, Sofia and the other students paint portraits of Minimus. After that, the class is given a new project: To make a model of their dream castle and bring it in for Show-and-Tell. Everyone is paired up for the project, and Sofia's partner is the shy Princess Vivian. Sofia goes over to introduce herself when the class is finished and says Vivian can come over to her castle to work on the project, but Vivian doesn't really want to but does agree to having Sofia go to her castle that afternoon instead. After school, Sofia is told rumors about Vivian by Amber and her friends: supposedly Vivian's parents are gnomes, she lives in a cave filled with glow-in-the-dark bats, and has a pet dragon. No one knows for sure if these rumors are true however since Vivian never talks to anyone and no one has ever been to her castle. Back home, Sofia is hanging out with James and Prince Zandar while they work on their castle when Miranda arrives to inform her that the coachman is waiting to take her to Vivian's castle. After her excuse to not go doesn't work, Sofia tells her mother about hearing that Vivian is strange, and that when she tried talking to her Vivian didn't say much. Miranda says she will not really know what Vivian is like until she truly gets to know her. Clover also offers to accompany her, which makes Sofia feel better. When they arrive at Vivian's castle, Sofia is greeted by Vivian's mother, Queen Cecily, who suggests to Vivian that she show Sofia her room. Sofia is relieved that it seems none of the rumors about Vivian are true but it turns out she does have a pet dragon, Crackle, who is very friendly. Sofia admits that she was a little scared to come over after hearing the rumors from the other girls, and Vivian reveals she is well aware of what they say about her, but is too shy to confront them about it. While the girls leave to go work on their dream castle, Clover is left with Crackle, who breathes fire when excited, and does so often since she has an excitable personality, to his dismay. Sofia has all kinds of ideas for the dream castle, but since Vivian can't think of anything, Sofia suggests they go to her favorite room in the castle to get an idea. Vivian brings her to the music room, and says the mandolin in particular is her favorite instrument. Sofia asks her to play it and offers to sing along. Eventually Vivian joins in the singing and their castle is soon complete. Sofia tells her she should try talking to others at school so they can find out what kind of person she really is, but Vivian is still unsure. The next day at school, Sofia and Vivian are talking about their dream castle when Amber and her friends enter the room, and Vivian ultimately gets too scared and runs away. Later that day, Sofia decides to go visit Vivian to check on her. Clover refuses to come along this time due to his fear of Crackle's fire breath, but in the end agrees to go with her. At Vivian's castle, Clover is quickly dragged off by Crackle to a room full of shish-kebabs, and finds out they taste better after she roasts them with her fire breath, making him re-think his opinion of her. Meanwhile, Sofia tells Vivian that everyone can get to know her tomorrow at show-and-tell, but Vivian would prefer that Sofia do all the talking, and nothing Sofia says makes her change her mind. When Sofia goes to retrieve Clover so they can leave, he shows her Crackle's talent for roasting food and his remark about talents gives her an idea. She goes back to Vivian's room and tells her she can play her mandolin while they both sing about the castle instead of talking about it, pointing out that Vivian became more confident after playing the mandolin last time. The next day at show-and-tell, Amber and Hildegard present their two castles, one for gowns and the other for shoes. Next is James and Zandar's castle, which is just a giant cannon. Finally it's Sofia and Vivian's turn. Vivian is scared at first, but with Sofia's encouragement, she is able to both play her instrument and sing without any problems. After they finish their presentation, Amber and the other girls come over, impressed by Vivian's musical talent and wanting to be friends."

      "Two Princesses and a Baby": " It's James and Amber's birthday, and since they are twins, it's a Double Birthday for them. Sofia wishes Amber a Happy Birthday and escorts her to the dining room where she has prepared some goldenberry pancakes with cinnimon whipped cream for the twins only to find that James has eaten them all, much to Amber's annoyance. She admits to Sofia that she is not happy sharing her Birthday with her brother like she used to be and wishes she could have a Birthday all to herself. Suddenly, thanks to a stray comment from Sofia, she comes up with an idea on how to get what she wants and leaves the table without finishing her pancakes. Meanwhile, Cedric is preparing his magic show for the twins' birthday party which he doesn't want to do. Just then, Amber comes in and asks him to cast a spell that will give James a different birthday and in return Cedric will never have to do another birthday magic show again. They find the spell for the job, but the spell goes wrong thanks to Cedric's allergies to pollen: Instead of making James two months younger than Amber, Cedric accidentally turns him into a two month old baby. Cedric and Amber both know if they don't change him back, they will be in serious trouble. Just when Cedric is about to find the counter spell, his spell book is knocked out of his hands by James and his dog, Rex, steals it to hide. While Sofia sends Clover to help Cedric find Rex and the spell book, Amber decides to make do with a birthday all to herself but Sofia insists that they keep an eye on James until Cedric can change him back. In the castle, James is having a lot of fun messing around and nearly breaking things. While Sofia tries to keep him under control, Amber is more busy picking games for “her” birthday party. James even finds his old favourite toy: a kazoo that he used to blow in Amber's face many times which made her hide it away from him. Sadly, he breaks it and starts to cry but Amber manages to calm him down. After he calms down, James starts to run off around the castle with Amber and Sofia in pursuit. They soon catch him and then go to the kitchen to pick the birthday cake. Amber, as always, wants strawberry cake but James, as always, wants chocolate cake and begins to stuff his face, getting all messy with chocolate. Amber laughs, remembering how James has kept up the habit of messy eating. Meanwhile, Cedric tries using a crystal ball to find his spell book. Clover, Mia, and Robin try to trick Rex into digging up the spell book but he turns out not to be an easy dog to fool and runs off back to the castle to get a snack. For the moment it all seems hopeless but luckily Robin comes up with a plan. They give Rex a bone and when he does he'll go off and bury it leading them to where he buried the book. Amber and Sofia are trying to clean up James but it soon turns into a playful water fight between the twins. Rex takes the bait and goes off to bury the bone where he buried the spell book. Clover, Mia, and Robin follow him and manage to get it back for Cedric who takes the credit for himself. Sofia and Amber take James to Amber's room where they find a present on her bed, from James. It turns out to be a golden locket with a picture of Amber and James inside. Cedric soon shows up with the spell book and just before he could cast the counter spell they discover James has disappeared. The three of them start searching the castle for him but it turns out to be hopeless. Amber manages to get James to come out of hiding by singing their royal twin song, which they use to sing when they were little. Cedric finds the counter spell and changes James back to his original age (with no memory of the experience) just in time for the twins' birthday party. At the party, Amber gives James his newly repaired kazoo and their parents give a bicycle for James and a unicorn for Amber. James and Amber decide to share their gifts and begin to happily chase each other around the castle grounds."

      "The Curse of Princess Ivy": " In the Royal Gardens, Sofia is playing hopscotch with her animal friends while singing a rhyme about witches and wizards. Unbeknownst to Sofia, Amber is spying on her and hears her talking to them in a way that reveals she can understand what they're saying. When Amber confronts her about it, Sofia tries to convince her that it's nothing but Amber sees through her sister's excuses and proves her case beyond any reasonable doubt by stating she heard her tell Clover \"his rhyme was funny.\" Realizing she's been caught, Sofia finally reveals the secret of her Amulet. Hearing this, Amber wants a turn wearing the Amulet, but Sofia refuses to take it off because she promised their father she would wear it always and never let it out of her sight. Meanwhile, everyone is preparing the castle for King Roland and Queen Miranda's wedding anniversary ball. Amber asks her father why he gave Sofia \"the best Amulet in the kingdom,\" and demands one just like it to no avail. That night, Amber decides to have a sleepover with Sofia in her room, much to Sofia's surprise. Sofia states that she was mad at her but Amber claims to have gotten over it and it's okay if Sofia can't take off her Amulet. Sofia agrees to have a sleepover with Amber: the two of them build a tent, play cards, and then go to sleep. But later that night, Amber reveals that she's still awake and has decided that if Sofia won't let her have a turn with the Amulet, she'll have to take one herself but doesn't seem to have the courage. In the morning, while Sofia is still sleeping, Amber decides to take one little turn and give it back when she's done. She takes Sofia's Amulet, runs to her room and puts it on revealing she wants a Princess to appear for her. She tries to summon Rapunzel, but instead summons a Princess dressed in black and white known as Ivy. The two Princesses greet each other warmly and Amber invites Ivy a tour of the castle, while magical black and white butterflies begin to change everything in the castle black and white. Meanwhile, Clover tries to wake up Sofia, but finds that she can’t understand him because her Amulet has been stolen. Once Clover finally wakes her up and she discovers it's missing, Sofia panics until she realizes Amber has taken it and goes all around the castle looking for her while everyone else is dealing with the butterflies. Outside, Sofia catches Amber with her Amulet, and Amber introduces her to Princess Ivy. Realizing that something's amiss, Sofia explains to Amber the Amulet only summons Princesses when there's an emergency and then sends them back. When Ivy hears this, she sends one of her butterflies to steal it from Amber. Princess Ivy reveals her true colors as an evil Princess who was exiled to a deserted island when she tried to overthrow her older sister, who became Queen of their black and white kingdom. Now that she is free she desires to claim Enchancia as her own kingdom and to make sure she never returns to her isolated imprisonment, she plans to destroy the Amulet. Sofia calls for a guard to stop her but Ivy conjures up a dragonfly which zaps him. When Sofia sees his memory has been erased, Ivy explains the power of her dragonflies and warns Sofia to stay out of her way or else. Sofia angrily turns to Amber and tells her this is the worst thing she's ever done. Amber tries to defend her actions by asking why the Amulet summoned an evil Princess. Remembering the Amulet's rule, Sofia realizes that what brought Ivy here was actually a curse that the Amulet put on Amber when she stole it. The girls go to Cedric for help and tell him about Princess Ivy and her plans to take over the Kingdom and destroy the Amulet. Cedric tells them the Amulet is indestructible and the only thing that can destroy it is the fire breath of Enchancia's eldest dragon, Everburn. He also tells Amber in order to stop Ivy, she must break the curse the Amulet put on her by returning it to Sofia. At first, Amber doesn't understand why she has to go after Ivy until both Cedric and Sofia remind her that since she's the person who caused this problem in the first place, she is the only one who can fix everything. Unfortunately, Ivy's butterflies hear everything and fly away to tell her. When Ivy takes a coach and flies to the Blazing Palisades, Sofia, Amber, and Cedric follow her in one of the old coaches. Upon arriving, they being to climb the mountain with Amber complaining about how steep it is, only to be silenced by Sofia who angrily reminds her she's the reason that they have to do this. Amber is shaken by Sofia's anger as she's normally forgiving. Cedric explains to her that since she stole her Amulet, Sofia no longer has any trust or respect for her. He recalls his own sister who used to steal his stuff all the time, and although he never got over it, he's sure Sofia will get over it. The trio find Ivy trying to get Everburn to melt the Amulet. However, with a bit of magic to distract them, Sofia gets back the Amulet, but the curse is not broken. Sofia and Amber refuse to give Ivy the Amulet and run out of the cave only to wind up falling down a chasm. Ivy's butterflies try to get the Amulet, but Everburn tells her to leave them alone or he'll start roasting her butterflies, leading Ivy to go back to the castle. Everburn is too big to fit in the hole to rescue the Princesses, and Cedric can't find his wand because his memory was erased by one of Ivy's dragonflies. Down in the hole, Sofia remains mad at Amber for her actions and regrets trusting her. Finally, Amber, realizing she has been a terrible sister, comes to understand that Sofia trusted her with her secret and she let her down in order to get something she wanted. She sits beside her and apologizes for everything which makes Sofia finally forgive her and cause the Amulet to glow and summon Rapunzel who helps them out of the hole with her long hair. Sofia, Amber, Rapunzel and Cedric climb onto the Dragons and fly back to Enchancia. While flying, Amber confesses to Rapunzel that Ivy's presence is a curse on her because she stole Sofia's Amulet. Rapunzel tells Amber that in order to break the curse and send Ivy back for good, she must perform a selfless act made out of loyalty to Sofia. She wishes Amber good luck and returns to her own kingdom. Amber and Sofia find the entire castle in black and white. Roland tries to command Ivy to stop but ends up being hit with a dragonfly, along with Miranda, James, and Baileywick. Then, she hits Cedric with another dragonfly after he refuses to remove the Amulet from Sofia. She then turns to Sofia and tries to hit her with a dragonfly but Amber saves her by letting herself take the hit. Her self-sacrifice breaks the curse, defeating Princess Ivy and sending her back to her island prison. The colors across the kingdom are restored and because the dragonflies erased everyone’s memories, no one but Sofia and her animal friends remember any of the occurred events. The Royal Family proceeds down the hallway to celebrate Roland and Miranda’s wedding anniversary, with Amber telling Sofia she is glad to have her as a sister."

Merlin tells the class that as they are about to enter their final semester at Royal Prep it is time for them to dream bigger dreams and shoot for higher skies. Because of this, they will do advanced Alchemy for the rest of the school year. Sofia is wowed by all the projects they will be working on from now on such as turning sawdust into gold dust. Prince Desmond tells her they will be harder than anything they have done before. Merlin concurs and tells the students that is why they will need animal helpers for the rest of the school year. After bringing in his animal helper Archimedes, Merlin explains that all top wizards have animal helpers to help with all sorts of useful things such as fetching ingredients, stirring ingredients, and opening scrolls. Hildegard asks if Lulu can be her helper, and Merlin tells her any animal will do as long as they are focused and hardworking. He then tells them their first advanced Alchemy project is due tomorrow, and their animal helpers will help make it in class. Sofia decides to pick Clover to be her helper and looks through her book to find a project for her and Clover to make. Meanwhile, Prisma and Twitch enter the Three Good Fairies' office. Prisma pulls out the Locket and asks the spirit what the object is. The Spirit tells her it is the Spinning Wheel spindle that Princess Aurora pricked her finger on. After failing to find it, Prisma asks where it is. The spirit tells her it is inside a secret passageway that she must light a candle on the wall to open. Prisma tries to light the candle, but the candle keeps blowing itself out. The spirit reveals that Flora, Fauna, and Merriweather have put a protection spell on the passageway, and Prisma must break it in order to enter. Suddenly, Sofia and Fauna enter the office. Sofia has decided to make Dragon Fire for her project. Fauna is happy to help Sofia with her project and gives her the rarest ingredient that she needs to make it: Lightning Spark. Noticing Dragon Fire Ash on the candle, Prisma deduces that Dragon Fire is the key to undoing the protection charm and decides to use the Dragon Fire Sofia makes to do it. Back at Enchancia Castle, Sofia finds Clover and asks him to be her animal helper. He accepts, but suddenly Sofia's other animal friends show up saying they want to be her animal helper. Sofia decides to hold tryouts to pick her animal helper. At the tryouts, Clover is the first in line. However, he soon has trouble due to not being able to tell one ingredient from the next. Wormwood shows up to check out \"the next generation of animal helpers\" and finds them all lacking. Clover is still having trouble to the point where his tryout fails. Clover wants to try again but Robin tells him he should let her and the others have a turn. Sofia agrees on the grounds that Alchemy Class is very important to her, but agrees to give him a second chance if he gets lessons from Wormwood first. Nearby, Prisma and Twitch, having followed Sofia back to her Castle, are watching everything. Prisma notes that Clover was terrible and suggests that Twitch be Sofia's animal helper. Twitch turns himself into a weasel and Prisma covers his diamond marking with a handkerchief. Twitch then goes up to the tryouts. In Cedric's Workshop, Wormwood tries to teach Clover a rhyme to help him identify the ingredients. Unfortunately, Clover has trouble remembering everything, and Wormwood finally gets so fed up that he kicks him out. Meanwhile back at the tryouts, things are not going well. The only animal who does a good job is Twitch. Sofia notes that he is really good at this, and he would make a great animal helper. However, she still rejects him as she does not know him and wants one of her friends to be her helper. As Twitch leaves, Clover intercepts him and asks him for tips. Sensing an opportunity, Twitch turns himself into a chameleon and offers to coach him through his second tryout. Clover takes his turn again. Twitch blends in with his camouflage and tells Clover which ingredients is correct, making him successfully help Sofia make the Dragon Fire. Twitch tries to steal the Dragon Fire but fails as his chameleon form is not strong enough to carry it. After putting the Dragon Fire out, Sofia tells Clover he can be her helper, to his joy. Clover asks Twitch to help him the next day as well and Twitch says yes. After everyone leaves, Twitch tells Prisma he has a way to steal the Dragon Fire tomorrow. The next day in Alchemy Class, the Princes and Princesses are doing their projects. When Sofia takes her turn, Twitch once again coaches Clover through it and they once again make Dragon Fire. Twitch then turns himself into a hawk and steals the Dragon Fire. Sofia and Clover give chase, and catch up in time to see Prisma use the Dragon Fire to open the secret passageway to steal the Wicked Nine object they are after. Having seen Twitch's diamond marking, Sofia realizes that Twitch is the same Strangeling who tried to steal the Falcon's Eye in Wei-Ling. Clover admits he had been cheating so he could be with Sofia. He does not think he is worthy of helping her anymore, but Sofia convinces him to try before Prisma gets the Spindle. At first Clover still forgets, but finally remembers the rhyme Wormwood taught him. Clover successfully helps Sofia make Dragon Fire on his own and they go after the pair. Meanwhile, Prisma and Twitch find an organ and, after playing it, open another passageway and get the Spindle. Sofia and Clover appear and, after a struggle, get the Spindle from them. Sofia sends Clover to give it to the Fairies. However, Prisma uses the Necessi-Key Twitch stole from Sofia to make a magical door to once again escape. Back in Alchemy Class, Merlin gives Sofia and Clover medals for their great work."

      "Camp Wilderwood": " The Royal Family of Enchancia arrive by coach at Camp Wilderwood. Sofia is excited to be attending but the twins are not. Amber wanted to stay home and look for meteor showers and James wanted to go to Flying Carpet Camp with Zandar. Miranda assures the twins that they will have a great time like their father did. According to Roland when he first went to camp he was not sure about it either but he ended up having a great time. Sofia assures her father that she will make sure her brother and sister have a great time and, as soon as they are dropped off, Roland and Miranda head home. Sofia tells Amber and James that they will love it at Camp Wilderwood since they will be doing tons of new activities and will make a lot of new friends. The assembled campers meet the Camp Counselors: Marty and Maple. They tell the campers that they have over fifty Enchanted Activities and over five hundred species of Enchanted Plants and Animals. However, they do warn the kids that there is Itching Ivy there too. James asks Sofia what Itching Ivy is, only for her to point out that he is standing on a piece. Sofia tells him that it can give a person an extreme case of the itches that is super contagious if someone touches it, and advises him to stay away from it. Later, Sofia instantly befriends a girl named Mandy but the twins are having trouble making friends: Nobody recognizes Amber and nobody wants to be infected by the Itching Ivy that James stood on. They also run into Wendell Fidget, who is at the camp because of all the naughty stuff he did in the past. The Royal Kids arrive at Enchanted Arts and Crafts. James is forced to sit by himself because nobody wants to sit next to \"The Itchy Kid\" while Sofia takes Amber over to sit next to Mandy. Amber laments that nobody knows who she is and that Sofia makes friends so easy. James is having trouble too: His Enchanted Silk Weaver gets him tied up in the silk he is supposed to sew and spin. At Wendell's instigation, the other kids laugh at James. Sofia comes over to help but her humiliated brother rebuffs by rejecting her help. James has even more trouble at the Enchanted Wall Climbing: As he is climbing the wall, the Itching Ivy's itching kicks in and makes him fall on the cushion. Sofia tries to comfort him but James again rebuffs and wants to be left alone. That night, he writes a letter home to his parents asking them to come pick him up. The next day at breakfast, Mandy tells Sofia that Marty and Maple are going to make an announcement and invites her to sit with her so they can guess what it is. Sofia assures her that she and Amber will be right over. Sofia then notices that Amber is upset because she has still not made any new friends yet. When Sofia spots James walk by, she goes up to see what is wrong as well as to see what he is doing. James is sending a letter to their parents asking them to take him home. Sofia can understand he is having a rough time and assures him that things will get better. She also pleads for him to come to the announcement and he reluctantly agrees. Later, Maple and Marty make their announcement: It is time to start the Inter-camp Competition, where Camp Wilderwild will face the Junior Knights in the annual Flag Race. In the race each teams from each camp will compete to place their camp's flag on the island in front of the camp by building boats to sail to the island. The fairies tell the campers to find a buddy to make teams of two. Everyone gets a buddy except Sofia since she insisted that Mandy and Amber be buddies. Wendell and James become buddies due to their shared dislike of Camp Wilderwood and they plot an escape. When Amber sees that Sofia does not have a buddy she and Mandy invite her to be part of their team. That night, James and Wendell steal Camp Wilderwood's flag to make a sail for their escape boat. The next day, everyone arrives for the race only for Maple to report the flag missing before allowing the race to start. When the race starts, James and Wendell try to sail away but Sofia's team boat runs aground. James goes back to help his sisters. When they get aboard, James and Wendell reveal their plan. Sofia convinces them to stay and win the race. Their boat gets to the island first, where James and Wendell win the race. Marty tells them to ask next time they want to use the flags. James and Wendell arrive back at camp where the other kids swarm Amber, James, and Wendell, who finally start to love camp. Everyone then heads to the Mess Hall for cookies."

      "The Fliegel Has Landed": " In the Trolls' cave, Sofia, Teeny, and Gnarlie are playing hide n' seek. During the game, Chief Gnuckles, the leader of the Castle Trolls, comes by. He tells the trio about cave crystals and how beautiful and rare they are and how each troll only gets one. After he leaves, the trio resume their game with Gnarlie being the one who hides. While looking for a hiding place, Gnarlie bumps into a fliegel named Grotta, who takes his cave crystal and tells him what she's about. She demands that Gnarlie get her more crystals. Gnarlie suggests that she ask Chief Gnuckles for some but Grotta retorts that she doesn't ask, she tells, and she's telling him to get her some more crystals. Gnarlie tells her she can be nicer about it but again Grotta retorts that she doesn't have to as she is a fliegel. She calls for a mole named Flinch and tells him to find a place for the crystal she took. After he accidentally knocks a bucket over it and darkens the room, Grotta freaks out until Flinch gets the crystal back out. Gnarlie asks \"Are you afraid of the dark?\" but Grotta lies and denies it. She also hand him the bucket and issues Gnarlie an ultimatum: Bring back the bucket with it filled with cave crystals or she'll turn him into a salamander. She also warns him not to tell anyone about her stating \"You go blabbin and I go zappin.\" Gnarlie bumps into Sofia and Teeny and asks them to help him mine for cave crystals which they agree to do. Despite hours of work, all they can find is one cave crystal, to the despair of Gnarlie who runs off. Sofia and Teeny realize something's wrong with Gnarlie and go after him. Gnarlie meets up with Flinch, who reveals that expecting Grotta to be an understanding person is a mistake which he found out the hard way when she turned him into a mole. Grotta appears and is furious that Gnarlie only brought back one crystal. She tells Gnarlie to bring her more crystals by the time her candle burns out or else she is coming for him. Gnarlie bumps into Sofia and Teeny who saw and heard everything. After getting the story out of her friend, Sofia goes to get help to get more crystals. Sofia goes to Cedric and asks him to make some cave crystals with his spellcasting abilities. Cedric attempts to do so but he conjures up a bunch of chickens instead because instead of grabbing diamond dust, which he's out of, he grabbed eggshell powder instead. When he asks why she needed cave crystals, Sofia tells him about Grotta and her ultimatum. Hearing about the fliegel, Cedric offers to get rid of her instead stating that he is always happy to rid the kingdom of a pesky fliegel. Sofia and Gnarlie lead Cedric to Grotta and Sofia, Cedric, and Teeny tell her to leave Gnarlie alone. After she refuses to listen, Cedric tries to get rid of her with a banishing spell but he fails due to conjuring up chickens instead because his wand is still coated with eggshell powder. Grotta seizes the opening and turns Cedric into a salamander. After Teeny blurts out about the ceiling crystals, Grotta tells Gnarlie to bring her those or she'll turn the others into salamanders too. Sofia entrusts Cedric to Teeny's care and goes back to the castle. Sofia goes to her mother and explains the situation and Miranda tells her daughter that the only way to deal with a bully is to stand up to them and get help. Sofia goes back to the cave and tells Gnarlie, who couldn't take the ceiling crystals due to his people loving them too much, to do what her mother advised. Grotta shows up and threatens Gnarly. Sofia defends him by telling Grotta to leave him alone, but Grotta decides to pick on her instead and takes Sofia captive with a spell and takes her prisoner. She gives Gnarlie another ultimatum: Bring the ceiling cave crystals to her and she'll let Sofia go. Taking Sofia's advice, Gnarlie goes to Chief Gnuckles and explains the situation. Together. the trolls confront Grotta. Gnarlie subdues her using her fear of the dark. Repentant, Grotta frees Sofia and turns Cedric and Flinch, who's revealed to be a salamander, back to normal. Grotta reveals that the reason she's mean is because no one has ever been nice to her before. Sofia encourages her to ask nicely, which she does, and the trolls gladly give her their crystals. That said and done, Gnarlie thanks Sofia for her help and everyone settles down for a nice cup of cave moss tea."

      "Let the Good Times Troll": " Sofia, James and Amber are flying kites when Sofia trips and loses hers. She is about to go down and retrieve it when Amber tells her the area down below is where the Castle Trolls live, and that they're supposed to be dangerous. However, Sofia still goes down there, anyway, though she is scared off when she sees a troll peering out through the rocks and leaves her torn kite behind. Sofia brings up the trolls at dinner, which prompts King Roland to mention the story of King Gideon and the trolls. Back when their great-grandfather Gideon was King, he heard a loud thumping outside the castle one night, and discovered a bunch of trolls banging their clubs on the ground. The frightened King summoned his guards to chase trolls away and since then no one has ever seen them outside their cave because King Gideon later made a rule saying that the trolls have to stay below in their cave and the castle's inhabitants have to stay above close to the castle. The next morning, Sofia's repaired kite has somehow been returned to her. Realizing the troll she saw yesterday fixed it and returned it, she decides to go and thank him. While Sofia is looking around in the cave for the troll, he pulls her off the bridge she was crossing, since it's unsafe. He then introduces himself as Gnarlie and brings her to the grotto, where there is a giant wall of crystals that look like a starry night sky, since the trolls love looking at stars. When Sofia asks why they stay in the cave looking at these fake stars instead of going out to see the real ones, Gnarly tells her the story she was told last night, though from the trolls' point of view: Their great-grandparents went out to look at the stars and were so happy they started banging their clubs on the ground, before they were chased away by the king's guards and forbidden to leave their cave again. Sofia also learns that the trolls make music by banging their clubs against the ground, and realizes that King Gideon's story was all a misunderstanding that occurred because the late King had jumped to conclusions without getting the facts first. Sofia tells James about her meeting with the trolls and what actually happened between them and King Gideon. The two decide to come up with a plan to show everyone there is no reason to be afraid of the trolls. When they notice a troupe of acrobats going into the castle, who will be performing for their family that night after dinner, Sofia comes up with an idea to have the trolls perform for the King and Queen. Sofia tells Gnarly that she and James can sneak them in while everyone else is having dessert, and they will hide until the acrobats are finished. Although Gnarly is unsure, he still chooses to go along with the plan. After dinner, Sofia and James claim they are full and don't want dessert and then run off. The trolls are successfully brought into the throne room and hidden behind the curtains, where they will wait until Sofia announces there is one more surprise. Once the acrobats are finished, Sofia makes the announcement and, after James pulls back the curtains, the trolls reveal themselves and begin to make their music. Thinking they're attacking, Roland orders his guards to seize them despite Sofia's plea to leave them alone. The trolls manage to escape, but Roland remains displeased about Sofia bringing them into the castle and has her along with James and Amber sent to their rooms until the castle is safe, as he plans to have a guard placed outside the trolls' cave by tomorrow. Knowing she may never see her new friends again, Sofia goes to the cave with her animal friends so she can apologize to Gnarly and say goodbye since this will be her only chance to do so. In her haste to get to the cave, Sofia fails to notice that she has been spotted by Roland who goes after her. Roland manages to catch up with Sofia as she once again crosses the unsafe bridge resulting in the two of them falling through it and into a pit. Trapped together at the bottom of the pit, Sofia manages to get her father to see that everything that everyone believed about the trolls was wrong and the whole \"troll attack\" was a huge misunderstanding that happened because his grandfather jumped to conclusions without even trying to get the facts first just like he did. Just then, Gnarly and the other trolls arrive to help pull Sofia and Roland safely out of the pit. Roland apologizes for how the trolls have been treated and later goes on to issue a proclamation that the trolls are free to come to the castle and look at the stars whenever they want and Miranda makes Sofia promise she'll never go into a dark cave alone again."

Vivian delivers the berries and asks her parents if she can keep the baby dragon, and they say yes. Vivian names him Crispy, takes care of him, and gives him Crackle's blankie, which makes Crackle jealous, causing her to take back her blankie. Clover tells her off, and Crackle goes to give it back. Upon doing so, Crackle learns that Crispy is not a baby dragon at all, but an adult dragon who is planning to rob Zumaria's Royal Jewel Room. After Crackle refuses to help him, Crispy vows to get rid of her. Crackle goes and tells Clover what she has discovered, but he does not believe her due to her prior jealousy. Suddenly, Chef Pietro, the Royal Chef of Zumaria, is heard screaming in the kitchen. All the pies he made with the Squishberries Sofia and Vivian brought back have been eaten, and scorch marks have been found. Vivian blames Crackle for this, and tells her no berries for a week. Crackle tells Sofia that it was Crispy who did it to frame her, but Sofia does not believe her because as far as she knows he is just a baby who cannot even fly. To prove it, Crackle has Clover come with her on a trail from the kitchen. At the trail's end, Clover sees that Crispy did eat the pies and that Crackle was right about him. The pair give chase all over the castle. Crackle and Crispy go into Vivian's room, where he scorches Vivian's new mandolin and fakes a burn. Vivian sends Crackle outside, where she packs her things and flies away with the thought of not being wanted anymore. Sofia tells Vivian, who goes after Crackle and apologizes. While Vivian is gone, Clover tells Sofia that Crackle was right about Crispy, and they confront him in the Jewel Room. Crispy is shocked that Sofia can understand him, and puts up a fight that concludes with Crispy locking Sofia in the Jewel Room. Sofia gets out through the lock using her shrinking ability. The pair resume going after Crispy to his shock. Crispy tries to trap them under a chandelier. Sofia gets them out, and they chase him outside, where he is apprehended by Crackle, who has just returned with Vivian. Sofia tells Vivian the truth about Crispy. Vivian realizes that Crispy did everything she blamed Crackle for, and apologizes to her pet for the way she treated her. A policeman arrives and reveals that Crispy is a wanted thief who is wanted from Zumaria to Corinthia, and takes him away."

Sofia needs to get the bowstring for hers from the Mare of the Mist on the Isle of Unicorns. Since she cannot fly unassisted, Sofia needs a Protector Steed and Skye has volunteered.

      "Pin the Blame on the Genie": " In the Kingdom of Tangu, Sofia and her father are at the Palace to have trade discussions with King Habib. Habib tells Roland that there is still time before the discussions begin and asks him if there is anything he wants to do. Roland says he wants to go to the marketplace to find a new shawl for Miranda. Sofia agrees as she also wants to see her friend Kazeem. Omar, the Royal Wizard of Tangu, comes out of his caravan and denounces Kazeem as a mischievous troublemaker. Habib tells Sofia to excuse Omar as he is not fond of genies, to which Omar states is because he finds them silly. Sofia defends Kazeem by telling Omar that Kazeem is on the Genie Patrol and takes the job seriously. Suddenly, Kazeem comes in and crashes into Omar. Kazeem is pursuing a rogue genie named Ali Bobo who is breaking all the Genie Rules. Habib is horrified when Ali Bobo turns one of his servants into a cake. After he asks what they should do, Sofia tells him Kazeem will take care of it. Using his Jinn Magic, Kazeem apprehends Ali Bobo just as Sergeant Fizz arrives. The pair make Ali Bobo undo what he did to the palace servent and puts him back in his lamp. Fizz then tells Habib that he and Kazeem have rounded up all the rogue genies in Tangu and will keep them confined in their lamps until they learn the Genie Rules. Pleased, Habib gives the pair the day off. Omar is angry that Kazeem crashed into him and denounces him as a menace, despite Kazeem's protests that was an accident. Sofia and Fizz defend Kazeem with Fizz declaring that he stakes his reputation on Kazeem stating \"If he's a menace, so am I.\" before heading back to Genie Patrol HQ and putting Ali Bobo's lamp in a cage. Kazeem, Omar, Habib, Roland, and Sofia head to the market. Sofia is telling Kazeem not to take what Omar said to heart when they find their path blocked off by camels. When Habib wishes for the camels to move, the camels suddenly sprout wings and start flying around. The camels knock a powder on Habib. Omar accuses Kazeem of being the one who made that happen and demands he be put back in his lamp. Kazeem states he did not do it but Omar says he is the only one who could have done it. Habib warns Kazeem there is to be no more funny business or else before leaving to change his outfit. To prove his innocence, Sofia and Kazeem go to Fizz and put him on the case. The trio look for clues but all the evidence they find all say that Kazeem did do it. Despite his protests, even Sofia is now starting to doubt his innocence. Nearby, Roland and Habib are eating fruit when all the fruit suddenly goes flying and falls on Habib. Furious, Habib puts Kazeem on trail to determine whether or not he is guilty. Thanks to Omar, Kazeem is found guilty. Sofia tries to vouch for Kazeem but she only makes it worse by revealing that she believes Kazeem did it by mistake. Hurt and feeling betrayed, Kazeem goes inside his lamp. Afterwards, Omar demands that the Genie Patrol be disbanded and Sergent Fizz goes inside his lamp using what Fizz said earlier as the reason. Habib agrees and orders Fizz to be in his lamp by sundown. Later, Sofia tells her father she believes she made a mistake at the trial. Roland tells her she should keep looking. Sofia goes to Fizz and convinces him to reopen the case. Sofia and Fizz head to the site of the fruit attack where they find Omar reversing the fruit spell. Since a Jinn Spell can only be undone by the genie who cast it, this instantly makes the pair suspicious of Omar. They follow him to his caravan where they discover that Omar is in fact a rogue genie. Omar pulls Fizz inside and reveals that he framed Kazeem so he could have the Genie Patrol disbanded. He then stuffs Fizz inside a lamp and leaves to undo the flying camel spell. Sofia goes back to Genie Patrol HQ and lets Kazeem out of his lamp. She then apologizes for doubting him and informs him of Omar's plot to frame him. Together, they take off and, working together, they expose Omar to Habib and apprehend him. Sofia then frees Fizz, who apologizes to Kazeem for doubting him too. With his innocence proven, Kazeem thanks Sofia for being a true friend."

When Sofia asks where Roland is, Miranda tells her that Roland and Baileywick are out on urgent Royal Business. In town, it turns out that Roland's urgent Royal Business is actually buying Amber, James, and Sofia some last minute gifts for the holiday. Meanwhile, Sofia gives Minimus candied carrots and discovers that all the flying horses except Minimus are sick. Meanwhile, the Royal Carriage gets caught in a blizzard on the way back to the castle and the spooked horses break away from the coach stranding Roland, Baileywick, and the others in the forest. Luckily, a woodsman comes by and offers them shelter which Roland, at Baileywick's urging, accepts. Back at the castle, both Sofia and Miranda become worried because Roland should've been back by now. Miranda summons Constable Myles and asks him to prepare the Royal Carriage. Since Minimus is the only flying horse that's not sick, he's hitched to the coach. Myles, Miranda, Amber, James, and Sofia take off to find Roland. What nobody notices is that Clover, Mia, and Robin are also on the coach because they want to help Sofia find her father. They fly through the sky searching for Roland. They notice the King's Horses rampaging without the coach and realize that something must have happened to Roland. The blizzard becomes so fierce that they are forced to land. When Sofia asks her mother and Myles what they should do now, Myles tells the young princess they should get back in the coach and wait out the storm. Sofia is too worried about her father to comply but her mother tells her that Roland's fine but when Sofia asks her how she knows all Miranda can say is \"I just do.\" Sofia, who cannot be satisfied with \"I just do\" as an answer, goes to Minimus and asks him what he thinks they should do but Minimus cannot do anything in a crisis other than panic uncontrollably. Suddenly, Sofia's amulet starts to glow and, knowing that this means a summoning is about to happen, Sofia heads into the forest so nobody can see it happen and gets there just in time for the amulet to summon Princess Aurora. Sofia asks if she has come to help but Aurora states that it's not her help she needs but Sofia insists that she does and tells her about her problem. Aurora tells her she can get all the help she needs from her animal friends. Sofia finally finds out that Clover, Mia, and Robin came with her. She asks them to tell the animals of the forest to look for her father. They all comply except Clover who'd rather \"sit in the nice, warm, toasty sleigh with Sofia,\" and Aurora vanishes. The forest animals search everywhere for Roland and finally find him in the woodcutter's cottage lamenting that he can't spend Wassilia with his family. Mia and Robin return and tell Sofia that they found Roland. Unfortunately, all Miranda, Amber and James can hear is chirping. Sofia, who knows she can't tell them what her bird friends are saying without revealing her secret, states that she thinks her bird friends know where Roland is and hops out of the coach. Miranda, unaware of Sofia's powers, goes after and stops Sofia from going any further. She tells Sofia that she understands that she wants to be with her father and she does too but as much as they all want to be together, she thinks that due to the blizzard, it wouldn't be tonight and tells her daughter that as much as she wants to believe it, she doesn't think her bird friends know where Roland is. But Sofia is able to prove that she's right when the Forest animals arrive with the Royal Flag and convince everyone to follow a white snowy owl to the woodcutter's cottage where they all reunite with Roland. Roland tells them everything. Sofia, who already got what she wanted for Wassalia, gives the presents her father got for her to the woodcutter's children with her brother and sister following suit.

Hakalo is having its Fire Pearl ceremony, a rite of passage where the heir to the throne proves they are worthy of the throne, and it's Lani's turn to take this rite of passage. Lani gets to choose someone to be her Ahkahuna, her guide during the difficult trip and she has chosen Sofia since she believed in her when nobody else did when they first met and Sofia agrees. Lani also reveals that she and her family have the power to control the weather and the test is to help her control her powers (and in addition, her temper, because when she gets really angry, she summons ominous storm clouds). Unbeknownst to anyone, Mamanu and her snake Milo are on the island for yet another revenge scheme. The next day, the rite of passage begins. They arrive at Lani's first challenge: The Lava Gates. When her powers fail to make the gate even budge, Lani gets frustrated and a storm starts to brew, but Sofia suggests Lani to her powers to force the Gates open with a boulder, and it works. Mamanu and Milo are following with the intention of destroying Hakalo with a storm by making Lani lose control of her powers. They demolish a bridge that Lani needs to cross but Sofia makes a new bridge with a totem pole. Mamanu sabotages this by making Lani lose her temper. The resulting loss of control over her powers destroys the new bridge, to Lani's despair. Back at Hakalo Castle, Roland becomes worried but Kamea tells him they cannot interfere because their daughters must do this on their own. Sofia helps calm Lani down with a duet about how she stops being angry. Taking Sofia's tip, Lani calms down and the storm ends, to Mamanu's dismay. Lani comes up with the plan to sled down the hill using what's left of the totem pole. She uses her powers to make snow and the plan works. Mamanu turns Milo into a three-headed snake and sics him on the girls. This causes Sofia and Lani to have a fight that makes Sofia storm off in a huff. Lani tries to get the pearl herself but without Sofia she quickly gets lost. Realizing what she has done, a repentant Lani goes after Sofia and apologizes to her and they reconcile. Lani gets the map back by making it hail. Mamanu punishes Milo by turning him to stone. Sofia and Lani arrive where the pearl is and run into Mamanu, who has the pearl. Lani's anger makes another storm, but Sofia calms her down and the storm stops. Mamanu throws the pearl into the volcano but Lani retrieves it with her powers. Lani then defeats Mamanu with her powers. Lani returns home and is welcomed into the Circle of Leadership for passing the test."

      "Great Aunt-Venture": " Today the carnival is in town and Sofia is rummaging through her closet, looking for a pair of shoes to wear. Just then, James calls out to her asking if she’s ready and she replies \"Almost.\" She finally has some shoes on but they don’t match. James tells her not to worry and quickly drags her along where they meet up with Amber. The trio are excited to be going to the carnival, especially Sofia who has never been to a carnival before. Sofia, Amber and James make it outside just in time to be told by their father that their Aunt Tilly is about to arrive, much to James and Amber’s horror. While Miranda looks forward to meeting her, James and Amber aren't. They tell Sofia that Aunt Tilly is boring, and the only exciting thing she does is bake pies. James and Amber try to talk their way out of seeing their aunt but Roland insists they stay put and be polite. A flying coach arrives at the castle and after landing with a lot of dust appears Aunt Tilly. She is delighted to see her brother Roland and Miranda. She greets James with a pinch on the cheek and mistakes Sofia for Amber and says she's grown so beautiful. She secretly tells Amber, thinking she’s Sofia, she was a funny looking baby prompting an annoyed Amber to tell her aunt she’s Amber. Sofia greets her Royally but Tilly says they are family and she is Aunt Tilly to her. After a warm greeting, the family make their way inside. Amber and James try to escape but Roland tells them the carnival can wait. Roland tells Tilly they will be having a family dinner in honour of her visit and asks if she could bake one of her special apple pies. Aunt Tilly is delighted to but requires some apples and some Little Helpers, much to James and Amber’s shock. The twins decline to help and run away to the carnival but Sofia however, not wanting to disappoint her aunt, volunteers to help. Before going off on their adventure, Aunt Tilly searches her carpet bag for some clothes for Sofia to wear since she’s not really dressed for the occasion. She pulls out a fish bowl, a vase of flowers, a bugle and finally a pair of clothes similar to her own. After changing her clothes, Sofia and Tilly start off on their journey. They arrive where the Arabella Orchard should be only to find out that it has moved. Sofia is confused as to how an orchard can move until Aunt Tilly tells her the Arabella Orchard are special apple trees that are always looking for the right place to grow which makes the Arabella Apples so rare and delicious. She brings out her Locus Pocus Map which is to Sofia a blank piece of paper. However, things aren't always as they seem. Following Aunt Tilly’s instructions, Sofia asks the map where the Arabella Orchid is and it magically shows the way. They must go through Melodious Meadow, across Gargantuan Gorge and then they will find the Orchard of the Arabella Apples. They find their way to the Melodious Meadow which is a huge meadow of tall sunflowers. Once inside the meadow they quickly get lost and the flowers are too high to see over. Sofia suggests they need to see over the flowers in order to find their way out. Aunt Tilly agrees and starts searching her carpet bag. She pulls out a few juggling balls, a clock, a cup of tea until final she finds some magic jumping shoes. She gives them to Sofia to put on. At first she finds it tricky to control them until she gives a third try. She is able to jump high enough to see over the flowers and leads the way out. After getting out of the meadow, Sofia and Tilly make their way to the Gargantuan Gorge. They find an unsafe rope bridge which collapses after testing it. They meet a sad giant who has a whole thorn bush stuck in his foot. After helping the Giant pull out the bush he helps them in return by carrying them to the other side of the gorge. They soon find the Orchard of the Arabella Apples and waste no time picking them until the trees disappear to find a new spot to grow. On the way back to the castle they come across a Wild Wooly Wombeast that steals their apples and flies away. Full of despair Sofia gives up all hope, they lost the apples and they can’t get more from the orchard since it's now gone. Aunt Tilly encourages her not to give up and using her head she will find a way to get their apples back. Using the Locus Pocus Map, they track down the Wombeast to the Horrid Hills. Using a big kite from Aunt Tilly’s carpet bag they fly to the very top of the Horrid Hills to where the Wombeast lives. They find the Wombeast cave and Sofia goes in alone where she finds not only the Wombeast but also a lot of eaten apples. With the use of her magic amulet she is able to talk to the Wombeast also known as Wilbur and sees that he is not all mean and scary as he appears. Making amends with Wilbur, Sofia gets the apples back and helps Aunt Tilly bake one of her special apple pies for their family dinner. Despite what she had been told by Amber and James, Sofia learnt by herself that Aunt Tilly is a great adventurer and she enjoyed spending the day with her."

      "The Mystic Isles Undercover Fairies": " On the Mystic Isles, Sofia and Chrysta have just completed a training session and are currently walking around the Isle of Fairies. Chrysta invites Sofia over for tea at her house. Shocked, Sofia notes that Chrysta certainly has changed since the events on Wassailia as she’s acting nicer and friendlier and not as aggressive. Chrysta tells her that everyone loves the new her. To prove her point, she flies up to say hello to two Fairies who fly away screaming. Sofia asks Chrysta what was that all about and Chrysta explains that she never fit in among most of the other fairies, who want nothing to do with her. When they get to Chrysta's house, they find an old Fairy sleeping on Chrysta's porch. Chrysta recognizes him as Snoozle and wakes him up. Snoozle tells her he needs her help right away before abruptly falling back asleep. Sofia asks Chrysta if he's okay and Chrysta explains that Snoozle is a Dream Fairy, a Fairy whose dreams always come true as they predict the future. Snoozle proves this when he wakes up and tells Sofia to take a step to her left immediately. Sofia does so in time to catch a Fairy baby named Daisy to her mother's relief. Chrysta asks Snoozle what his dream was and he explains that someone is trying to steal all the magic from the Pixie Cup. Snoozle and Chrysta explain to Sofia that the Pixie Cup is a magic blossom that only opens once a year. Young Fairies must pass a test in order to get their magic wands from the Pixie Cup when it opens. If someone steals all the magic from the Pixie Cup no Fairy will ever get a magic wand again and the beautiful magical things Fairies do will vanish forever. Sofia asserts that they have to prevent this and Chrysta asks Snoozle who the thief is. Snoozle tells them that he didn't see a face, but he did dream of Blue Butter, to Sofia's confusion. Snoozle explains that if they look for Blue Butter they will find the thief. Chrysta tells Sofia that if they're going to protect the Pixie Cup from a thief they need to be there when the blossom opens, which is this very day. Chrysta also points out that only Fairies taking the Pixie Cup Test are allowed in the Fairy Forest. Sofia suggests they go undercover as Fairies. Chrysta asks Sofia how she going to do that since she isn't a fairy. Sofia reveals her Amulet gives her the ability to turn into a Mermaid and then uses it to turn into a Fairy. Chrysta also voices how she might not be much help as she failed the Pixie Cup Test due to being different from the other Fairies. All stereotypical fairies are delicate and elegant while Chrysta is outgoing and strong because her dream was to be a Protector. Sofia offers to coach her to be a conventional fairy, due to how similar to being Royalty. The pair head to the Fairy Forest. Sofia and Chrysta arrive in the Fairy Forest and meet the other Fairies: Etheria, an Air Fairy from Upper Breezia, Flurry, a Frost Fairy, and two unnamed Fairies. Sofia introduces herself as an exchange Fairy from the EverRealm. Sofia decides that one of the Fairies is the thief since only those who are allowed in the Fairy Forest have a chance to steal the Pixie Cup. Suddenly, Bridget, the Forest Keeper shows up and leads them to where they will take the Test. On the way, Sofia asks Chrysta why she's allowed in to which Chrysta explains that Bridget is a Brownie, a wingless fairy. They conclude that Bridget also didn’t earn her wand. When they arrive, they meet the Pixie Cup Test's Judge: The Sugar Plum Fairy. She was the same judge who failed Chrysta when she was little. The Sugar Plum Fairy easily recognizes Chrysta as the fairy who acted differently, but Chrysta assures her she’s changed for the better. The Sugar Plum Fairy tells them the Test will be divided into three stages and if they fail even one they fail the whole test. The first phase is the Dew Dabbing. At first, Chrysta dabs too fast, causing some flowers to get too much dew until Sofia tells her to dab gently. When Flurry sneaks away, Sofia begins to suspect that she's the thief, to which Chrysta tells her not to jump to conclusions. The Sugar Plum Fairy passes everyone. They then move on to the next stage of the test: The Tooth Pull, the stage Snoozle is part of. The fairies have to take the tooth from under Snoozle without waking him up and leave him a gift. Bridget brings the tooth to which the Sugar Plum Fairy tells her to wash her hands. Flurry takes the first turn. Sofia watches her and realizes she went first just so she can sneak away again. Sofia goes after her. However, just when it looks like Flurry is revealing her hidden bad side, Sofia discovers she's just gathering flowers to make corsages for everyone. Flurry was innocent after all. Bridget comes over to tell Sofia that it's her turn. Sofia shows her kindness which surprises her because no one ever apologizes or picked up her shovel for her. The Sugar Plum Fairy passes everyone, but not Chrysta. After switching the tooth, the gift must be something nice, but she made a frost dragon instead of a swan. Chrysta, however, explains that dragons are nice when you‘re wearing gloves to protect yourself from their poisonous fangs. Sofia vouches for her because she wrangles them all the time. Surprised by the difference, the Sugar Plum Fairy passes her after all. During lunch, Flurry and Etheria give Chrysta a makeover, during which she takes her Enchantlet off, which she never did before. Meanwhile, Bridget is eating for which the Sugar Plum Fairy tells her to stop eating and serve the food. Bridget tells Sofia she can't help herself as she loves scones. The group moves on to the final stage: The Fairy Frolic. It’s a maze that the fairies go through to reach the Pixie Cup Flower, dip their wands in and officially earn them. Chrysta tells Sofia she loves the makeover. Sofia notes that she also forgot about their mission and they still don't know who the thief is. Chrysta tells Sofia she'll go first to find out who it is. After Chrysta gets going, Sofia finds a tunnel with a plate next to it. The plate has a scone with Blueberry Butter on it. Remembering what Snoozle said earlier, Sofia instantly realizes who the thief is: A certain someone who loves scones. She then climbs into the tunnel. Meanwhile, Chrysta has completed her turn and passed the Test. Suddenly, she and the Sugar Plum Fairy get trapped in vines. Sofia climbs out of the tunnel and tells Bridget she can come out now. Bridget is the thief. Sofia tells them she figured it out as all the clues pointed to her. Bridget admits that it's all true: She always wanted to be a real fairy, but the Sugar Plum Fairy failed her just because she wasn't acting like the other fairies. The Sugar Plum Fairy defends herself, as her “unfairylike” personality wasn’t “the fairy way”. Bridget then drains the Pixie Cup of its magic. Chrysta breaks free and frees the Sugar Plum Fairy. After Sofia gives retrieves her Enchantlet, Chrysta defeats Bridget and returns the magic to the Pixie Cup. However, the Fairy Frolic was damaged. Chrysta figures she failed, but the Sugar Plum Fairy is impressed because she saved the flower and she realized it doesn’t matter if Chrysta acts differently from other fairies. Sofia also says Bridget deserves her wand too. This surprises everyone including Bridget herself. The Sugar Plum Fairy now knows she shouldn’t have failed Bridget just because she acts differently so she lets her put a wand in the Cup as an apology for failing her. She then gives wands to everyone who took the Test, even Sofia, whom the Sugar Plum Fairy knew all along was a human Princess."

      "Cedric's Apprentice": " Sofia is taking her first Sorcery Class, which is taught by Fauna. The class learns the spell for turning a rock into a ruby. Sofia can't get it right and only ends up making food out of her rocks. She is unhappy that there are more spells to learn and a test on all of them at the end of the week. Back at the castle, Sofia is still struggling to get just that one spell right until Clover says that if she needs help learning sorcery she should ask a sorcerer, so she goes to see Cedric. Cedric is not interested in teaching her until Sofia suggests that in exchange for magic lessons she could help him out by doing some cleaning in his workshop etc. So Cedric makes her his apprentice, complete with her own wizard's hat, and says they'll start tomorrow. However, once Sofia is out of sight, he then concocts his newest plan to steal her amulet, which involves making and using an invisibility potion on himself and swiping the amulet while Sofia is busy with her apprentice duties. Cedric's father and mother emerge from a magical painting of themselves, which they gave their son so they could keep an eye on him. His father scolds him for wanting to usurp the throne, but his mother is supportive of his plan. Once they are back in the painting, Cedric firmly declares that he will rule the Kingdom and that no one will ever mock him or his spellcasting abilities ever again. During Sofia's first day as his apprentice, Cedric works on his invisibility potion while she sweeps the floor, but the finished potion only creates an explosion of confetti. He decides to try again later and begins teaching Sofia the proper way to cast a spell: doing it patiently and cautiously and Sofia finally succeeds in turning a rock into a ruby. Cedric is summoned by King Roland, who tells him that King Magnus will be visiting, and since King Magnus likes to brag about his own Kingdom, Roland would like Cedric to help make the castle look better. Cedric attempts to turn one of many gloomy-looking gargoyle statues into a golden horse statue, but ends up turning it into a real winged horse that flies away, and is rudely dismissed by the King. Back in his workshop, Cedric is telling Sofia about his father Goodwyn the Great, the greatest Royal Sorcerer ever, when Sofia accidentally knocks over a potion that turns her into a lizard. Cedric turns her back into a human and she praises his spellcasting skill asking why he couldn't get the spell used on the statue right. Cedric says he can't help getting nervous when in the king's presence, and Sofia says she'll show her father what a great sorcerer he really is because he's her friend. Cedric seems touched by her words. During dinner, King Magnus brags about his Royal Sorcerer, causing Sofia to comment that her family has a great sorcerer too and Cedric will even put on a show for them, much to Roland's dismay. Cedric is nervous about performing for two Kings but Sofia says they can help each other get ready since his show is on the same day as her sorcery test. While they practice, Cedric keeps working on his invisibility potion but it still doesn't turn out right until Sofia clears away a smudge on his spellbook page revealing there were two ingredients he didn't put in. After she leaves, Cedric finally creates a working invisibility potion and is celebrating his success when he notices a bunch of rubies put together to form a heart, that Sofia made for him. His parents appear with his father urging him not to take the amulet while his mother says he should but Cedric says he will make his own decisions. Sofia passes her Sorcery Test and, when she gets home, goes to help Cedric prepare for his magic show. Cedric appears to have decided to go through with his plan to use the invisibility potion to steal her amulet as the final part of his show. But once the show starts, he becomes nervous and the spell he uses to make Clover fly only makes Clover bounce around. Sofia knows that Cedric would do better if he was performing a spell he knew really well. So she purposely spills the lizard potion on herself, to everyone's horror, and Cedric flawlessly changes her back earning praise from everyone for \"saving Sofia's life.\" In the end, Cedric is unable to bring himself to carry out his plan to steal Sofia's amulet, due to her kindness towards him, and instead uses the invisibility potion on Clover. After the show, Sofia gives Cedric a gold star like the one she got for passing her test, and thanks him for his help. Cedric tells a disappointed Wormwood that they can always try taking over the Kingdom another time."

      "The Princess Test": " Sofia and the other girls are waiting for Dance Class to begin. Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather arrive and inform the girls that Dance Class has been cancelled, so they can all prepare for the Princess Test they'll be taking that day after school where they will show everything they've learned about being a true Princess. Sofia and Princess Jun decide to go to the library to study, with Amber and Hildegard deciding to accompany them just in case they have any questions, since the two of them claim to already know everything about being true princesses. At the library, Sofia asks the librarian, Mrs. Higgins, if there are any books about being a good princess. It turns out there are plenty of them and Mrs. Higgins gives Sofia and Jun two of her favorite books. Sofia is overwhelmed by all the subject material, that the other girls already know very well since they have been princesses their whole lives, unlike herself. Amber takes the group to another room, where she tells Sofia that what really matters is to keep her gown looking gorgeous. Hildegard also shows the proper way to flutter a fan. Finally, Jun and Maya say that knowing how to curtsy and dance are also important. Sofia thinks she is ready for the test now, and everyone starts making their way to the ballroom. Mrs. Higgins's wheelbarrow that she uses to cart her books around has broken and Sofia is the only one of the princesses who responds to her plea for help. Although the princess test is starting, Sofia agrees to help her carry the books home after Mrs. Higgins assures her that her house is fairly close by, and tells the concerned Amber she will make it back in time for the test. However, it turns out the two of them will have to take a longer route when they discover that the bridge across the stream is broken. Mrs. Higgins understands that Sofia wants to go back and take the test and says she can carry all the books home by herself, but Sofia decides to continue helping her. Back at school, the test has started. Hildegard forgets the answer to the very first question and begins to panic about failing the entire test. Amber tells her the test has just begun so she has plenty of chances to make up for her one mistake, but Hildegard is not convinced. Sofia asks Mrs. Higgins if her house is far from their current location and Mrs. Higgins offers to draw her a map, but instead draws a tic-tac-toe board as a joke, making Sofia a little frustrated since they are wasting time. They reach a narrow path through a split rock and Sofia politely allows Mrs. Higgins to pass through first stating that is what a proper princess would do, but she says Sofia is a proper princess. Sofia disagrees, telling her she wasn't born a princess and that she feels like she constantly has to prove she is one, but perhaps through the princess test, she can finally show everyone that she deserves her royal status. Mrs. Higgins comments that from what she's seen, Sofia will make a wonderful princess. Amber and Jun do well in the fan fluttering portion of the test, but Hildegard is still scared of messing up again, even though fan fluttering is her specialty as Amber reminds her, and decides to just give up on this part. Her friends don't want to see her fail the test but don't know what to do. Sofia is worried about the fact that it's getting late and the test is probably halfway over, but Mrs. Higgins says they're almost there. They cross another stream by hopping down a pathway of rocks and Sofia ends up losing her fan halfway along, causing her further distress. Mrs. Higgins once again offers to let her return to school, but Sofia stays to help, pointing out that her dress still looks good, which Amber said was the most important thing. Amber and Jun forcibly drag Hildegard out onto the ballroom floor, with Amber telling her that she could do great on what remains of the test, but she has no chance to if she just gives up. The girls are tested on their posture and must keep books from falling off their heads, and to make things a little challenging, pillows are magically flung at them while they walk. With encouragement from Amber, Hildegard gets through this part of the test with no problems. Mrs. Higgins's house is finally within view, but the path up ahead is covered with mud and Sofia does not want to ruin her dress. Mrs. Higgins gives her a third chance to go back to school so she can take the test, but Sofia again refuses and simply holds her skirt up a little to keep it from dragging through the mud. But just as they reach the end of the mud, they both slip and fall and Sofia's dress is ruined, which to her means she has no chance of passing the test now. In any case, they have arrived at their destination and Mrs. Higgins thanks Sofia for her help, and Sofia is glad that at least she helped her get home, even if it meant missing the test. Mrs. Higgins tells her she might still be able to make it to the test and ushers Sofia into her house. The house fades away and Sofia finds herself in the ballroom at school. To add to her confusion, a second Mrs. Higgins shows up, and the one that Sofia had helped reveals she is actually Fauna in disguise, and that it was all part of the test - one of the most important things about being a princess is kindness and a true princess always helps people in need, even if it means having to give up something important. So while the other girls all receive silver stars, Sofia is awarded a special trophy for passing with the highest marks."

      "In Cedric We Trust": " Roland, Sofia, and Baileywick are looking for Roland's white necktie, which he wears for all big Dunwiddie events, for the opening of the Dunwiddie Museum. While they look for it, Cedric comes in and offers to conjure a new one up for him. Roland refuses and decides to just wear his yellow one. Baileywick brings Roland his speech to memorize for the Museum Opening. Cedric offers to cast a spell that will enable Roland to memorize his speech much faster but Roland refuses him and dismisses him by stating \"That will be all, Cedric.\" As he leaves in sadness, Sofia catches up with Cedric, who admits that both Roland and himself have still not gotten over what happened when he tried to take over the kingdom. They used to be close when they were children. Whenever the expectation to live up to the standards of their larger than life fathers got too great, they would go outside and play Dazzleball. Cedric feels that time is gone forever. Sofia proposes that he comes with them to the Museum Opening and win back her father's trust by wowing him with his knowledge of Crownology. In his workshop, Cedric insists on bringing Wormwood since he only passed Crownology at Hexley Hall because Wormwood was his study buddy. Wormwood refuses at first, but in the end complies after Cedric reminds him that he is his master. At the Museum Opening ceremony, Roland declares the Dunwiddie Museum open, and leads everyone to the Crowns of Every Kingdom Exhibit. When Roland goes over to marvel over a crown, Cedric takes his chance to impress Roland. He asks Wormwood for info about the crown that he can wow the King with. Wormwood tells him that it is the Wreath of Rudistan: a crown that is made of Phoenix Feathers filigree and Elven Gold. Nearby, Prisma and Twitch are plotting to steal another of the Wicked Nine. This time they are after the Crown of Queen Grimhilde, Snow White's wicked stepmother. However they do not know what it looks like so Prisma pulls out the Locket of Vor to show them what it looks like. Unnoticed to them, Wormwood overhears them and wants in. Meanwhile, Cedric talks to Roland about the Wreath of Rudistan but gives Roland the wrong kind of gold by mistake, which Roland discovers the hard way, to his embarrassment. Roland angrily tells Cedric this is the last time he asks him to share his Crownology with him. Cedric notes Roland is still unimpressed and distrustful. Sofia admits that winning her father over will be more difficult than she thought but adds that he should do something sweet for him. So she leads Cedric over to a pudding cart and suggests giving her father some Jiggly Wiggly Pudding. Meanwhile, Prisma and Twitch move in to steal Queen Grimhilde's Crown, but they retreat when they see Sofia. Once they are back outside, Wormwood flies up and offers to help them steal it in exchange for Prisma becoming his new master. Prisma agrees and sends him to steal the Crown. A jealous Twitch objects to letting Wormwood in. Prisma notices his jealousy and sends him to make sure Wormwood succeeds. However, Twitch plans to make sure that Wormwood fails. Meanwhile, Sofia has brought Cedric to the Jiggly Wiggly Pudding cart. However, the man operating the cart cannot give them any as he is all out. So Cedric conjures some up for Roland, to his delight. However, the appearance of the Pudding brings a crowd over. A man bumps into Sofia, causing her to bump into Cedric, causing him to collide into Roland and spill the Pudding on him. Sofia assures her father it was not Cedric's fault and explains what caused it. Cedric tries to remove the stain which he does by making Roland's clothes vanish, to the dismay of Roland. A nervous Cedric tries to put Roland back in his suit but his nervousness makes him put the King in a clown suit. Roland accuses Cedric of trying to make him a laughingstock and leaves to change into his spare suit. Meanwhile, Wormwood distracts the guards and steals Grimhilde's Crown. After Roland changes into his spare suit, two soldiers come up and tell him about the theft and show a feather Wormwood left behind. Baileywick spots Wormwood in the distance making off with the Crown. When Cedric walks up, Roland accuses him of causing the Pudding fiasco on purpose to distract everyone while Wormwood stole the Crown. Cedric denies being involved but Roland does not believe him. Sofia tries to defend Cedric but Roland, as usual, does not take her seriously. He sends Baileywick back to Enchancia Castle to assemble the entire Royal Guard. To help out, Cedric enchants Wormwood's feather to act as a compass to lead them to him. Still believing that Cedric is involved in the theft, Roland is against him coming. Cedric and Sofia both tell Roland he is on his side and he wants to help prove his innocence. Roland relents on the condition that if his suspicions get confirmed Cedric will get thrown into the dungeon. Meanwhile, Wormwood is on his way back to Prisma with the Crown. Twitch tries to keep Wormwood from succeeding by launching a beehive at him and causes the bees to chase after Wormwood. The bee chase makes Cedric realize something is up and he goes off by himself. When Cedric finds Wormwood he demands that he return the Crown. Wormwood refuses and tells Cedric that he is not his master anymore as he wants power and Cedric is no longer evil enough to obtain it. Cedric and Wormwood fight over the Crown and Cedric gets it back. However, he also shouts \"The Crown is mine!\" This proves to be a mistake for when Roland shows up with Sofia he takes this as confirmation of Cedric's guilt. Cedric denies this and appeals to Sofia only to find that she now doubts his innocence too. While everyone's distracted, Wormwood steals the Crown and delivers it to Prisma. The Locket of Vor tells Prisma if she holds the jewel on the Crown in light she can use the Crown to fire earth-shattering lightning. The trio are on their way back to Enchancia Castle so Roland can have Cedric thrown into the dungeon when Sofia hears the evil trio's cackling. Upon investigating, she discover the evil trio and realizes what is going on. Meanwhile, Roland and Cedric notice that Sofia is missing and go back for her. Sofia confronts Prisma and gives her an ultimatum: Hand over the Crown or she will call the Protectors. Prisma just uses the Crown to shoot ground-shattering lightning at Sofia just as Roland and Cedric show up. Roland gives Cedric back his wand to fend off the wicked former Crystalmaster. To get her revenge on Sofia, Prisma uses the Crown to launch an attack meant to kill her but Cedric saves her. Prisma, Twitch, and Wormwood escape with the Crown. After making sure everyone's okay, Roland apologizes to Cedric, who asks Roland who that woman was, but Roland does not know. Meanwhile, Sofia secretly contacts Orion and Vega and informs them that Prisma has stolen one of the Wicked Nine."

      "The Bamboo Kite": " Sofia arrives in Wei-Ling to celebrate the Festival of Kites with her friends Prince Jin and Princess Jun. Upon arrival, she finds everyone giving their kites a practice flight. While it seems like a festival worth looking forward too, Jin tells Sofia that Jun has the summer sniffles, and might not be able to attend the opening of the festival the following day. Sofia asks Wu-Chang if there is a way to help her get better. The elderly sorcerer brings up the legend of a ancient rare flower, known as Men-Saing, which could instantly cure the summer sniffles. However, Emperor Quon appears to no longer have any need for Wu-Chang's wisdom and now seeks advice from his Adviser of New Things, who says Jun needs to rest for six and a half days to get better. While the old sorcerer feels unwanted, Sofia on the other hand believes they can find the Men-Saing flower. She volunteers to go and so does Jin, along with Wu-Chang. After all three of them suit up, they set out on their journey to Mount Disharn. For the trip, Jin has brought along all new gadgets to help them on their journey. He brought along a perfect pointer to show them which way they are go. They arrive at a huge wall that runs around central Wei-Ling, and there appears to be no way around it or a gateway. The only ways is to go over the wall, and while Wu-Chang uses a levitating spell, Jin and Sofia get over using a grappling slingshot. Upon making it to the other side, they meet a magical talking Panda named Kai who likes to dance. He offers to dance for them, but Jin declines because of their journey to get to Mount Disharn and help Jun. Kai sadly leaves, making Sofia and Wu-Chang feel sorry for him. So they decide to stay around to watch Kai dance. After an amazing performance, Sofia, Jin and Wu-Chang continue on their journey, until they hear from Kai that they won't make it to Mount Disharn before dark. However, he has a suggestion and presents them with a couple of bamboosts. They were very popular with the ancients because of their magical elastic properties. Hopping through the forest on the Bamboosts, Sofia, Jin, Wu-Chang, and Kai make it to Mount Disharn in no time. Now they have to get to the top of the mountain in order to reach the Men-Saing flowers. They will not be able to get the top by using the Bamboosts and Jin's grappling hook cannot reach. Wu-Chang has a suggestion. Gathering everyone onto a log he uses his levitation spell to fly them to the top of Mount Disharn. However, they are too heavy and Wu-Chang cannot hold them up any longer. They near a ledge and all four make it across just as Wu-Chang's spell give up. Wu-Chang apologizes for endangering everyone, but Jin assures him it is all right. Jin can now use his grappling hook to get them up the rest of the way. They finally reach the top and find the Men-Saing flowers, enough to brew a healing tea for Princess Jun. However, upon realizing how late it is getting their chances of getting back to Jun in time is slim. Wu-Chang steps forward to apologize to Jin because he feels responsible for causing so many delays with his old ways. But Jin points out that because of his old ways they made it to Mount Disharn along with the assistance of new ways. Kai believes there is a place for both ways, which gives Sofia an idea. Working together, they build a bamboo kite big enough to carry everyone back to the palace. After attaching Jin's Easy Breezy to the back to use as a propeller, Kai bids his friends farewell and dances home. Then Sofia, Jin and Wu-Chang take off in their kite and fly all the way back to the palace. They soon make it back in time to give Jun her healing tea. Convincing the Emperor, Jun drinks the tea and is instantly cured of the summer sniffles. The next day, the festival of kites begins along with Kai joining the festivities."

      "Baileywhoops": " The Kingdom of Enchancia is having its Royal Jubilee, which the Royal Families of Wei-Ling, Rudistan and Zumaria are invited to attend. When King Magnus arrives, Baileywick is greeted by his Castle Steward Slickwell, who gives him a double-headed snakepin. Baileywick gratefully accepts the gift and Slickwell wishes him luck before muttering to himself \"You're going to need it.\" The meaning of this ominous remark is revealed when Queen Cecily and her daughter Vivian arrive: Attempting to take the Queen's bag, Baileywick suddenly gets a bad case of clumsiness and crashes into King Roland. Slickwell helps Roland up and introduces himself. In the castle, King Roland explains the Jubilee itinerary to everyone: The Kings and Queens will play some games and go on a cruise while the Princes and Princesses will be entertained by King Magnus' sorcerer Greylock the Grand and, to the shock of everyone, Cedric. Cedric and Greylock compete fiercely against each other to show who is more fun by conjuring up origamis then balloons then pinatas, and finally, a flying carousel that together they entertain the Princes and Princesses with for the rest of the day. All the Princesses, that is, except Sofia who skips the whole thing because she is very worried about Baileywick. After another clumsiness attack, Slickwell urges him to retire stating he must have become too old to continue being Castle Steward of Enchancia but Sofia defends him and tells him she'll help him out by becoming his junior steward and puts on an outfit similar to Baileywick's, with earrings and her hair curled up in a ponytail. Meanwhile, Slickwell reveals he's after Baileywick's job and that the pin he gave him is a cursed object. The Kings and Queens are partaking in a croquet match in the castle courtyard and, thanks to Sofia, Baileywick is doing much better. Seeing the young Princess's aid as a threat, Slickwell deliberately interferes with Sofia's next attempt to help Baileywick on the pretext of cleaning her shoes and, without Sofia, Baileywick's clumsiness attacks cause another mishap. Slickwell again tries to convince Baileywick to retire stating, once again, that he's getting on in his years and that King Roland can surely find an able replacement but Sofia defends him and reminds Baileywick that when she first became a Princess she felt she couldn't do it and would have quit just like that if he and her parents hadn't supported her which encourages Baileywick to stay on. The Royals then head inside for the opening of the Jubilee gifts; Roland is very appreciative of the gift from Emperor Quon and Empress Lin-Lin, a beautiful antique vase, but is less enthusiastic about King Magnus' statue of himself which is what he gave last year. After the Jubilee cake is frosted, Sofia helps Baileywick bring it out perfectly. But this is rendered moot when Baileywick sneezes a huge cloud of powdered sugar into Roland, who stumbles back and crashes into the table of gifts, breaking the vase. This final humiliating mishap finally convinces Baileywick to resign as Castle Steward of Enchancia despite everyone's protests. Sofia tries to convince Baileywick not to retire by promising to do more that will make things easier for him like carrying things for him and serving the meals but Baileywick has made his decision. He appreciates everything Sofia has done for him and gives her the serpent pin Slickwell gave him before leaving to pack. Suddenly, Sofia and Clover both have clumsiness attacks that helps Sofia realize that Baileywick didn't get clumsy until Slickwell gave him the pin. Realizing the pin is what made Baileywick clumsy, they decide to confront Slickwell about it. Slickwell is in the kitchen ordering the servants around in Baileywick's place, but his manner is far less polite and they are very annoyed as a result. When Sofia and Clover get to the kitchen, the pin causes Sofia to fall and knock Slickwell's bag off the table. Inside it, she finds a book called The Beginner's Guide To Magically Cursed Objects. Reading it, they find out that the pin is called the Pin of Klutzenheimer, a cursed pin that puts a clumsiness curse on anyone who even touches it. Because of these discoveries, Sofia and Clover both realize Slickwell gave the Pin to Baileywick on purpose so he could steal the latter's job. Sofia tells Clover to make sure Slickwell doesn't get away with it and goes off to tell Baileywick of her findings. When Clover finds Slickwell escorting everyone to the cruise, he decides to give Slickwell a taste of his own medicine by putting the Pin on his coattails. The clumsiness curse then brings it's full weight to bear on Slickwell, who manages to spill the gooseberry cider all over the deck before knocking the wheel overboard with the schooner heading right for some rocks. Meanwhile, Sofia finds Baileywick just in time to tell him about the Pin and Slickwell's plot against him. Together, they go off to confront Slickwell and arrive just in time to find the Royal Schooner in danger and, with help from Greylock and Cedric, they manage to rescue everyone onboard. Once everyone is safe, Roland apologizes to everyone about the cruise and mess. Slickwell offers to clean up the mess but Sofia steps forward and proceeds to tell everyone on the Royal Schooner about Slickwell's plot and the Pin. Slickwell finally realizes that the reason why he started being clumsy is because the Pin was somehow placed on him and finds it just in time to prove that Sofia is telling the truth. The infuriated Royals advance on Slickwell, who tries to offer an explanation but Roland angrily cuts him off and tells him his services are no longer required. Slickwell protests that Roland can't fire him because he works for King Magnus causing Magnus himself to step forward and instantly fire him. Slickwell tries to get him to change his mind but his plea is cut short by the Pin's curse and the guards escort him to the gates and throw him out, where the Pin continues to add insult and injury to him. Everyone gladly welcomes Baileywick back and the Jubilee celebration continues with him back in charge."

      "Buttercup Amber": " At the castle, the Royal Family is gazing at the stars. Roland tells his kids about star stones, star shaped stones that glow, and how they are only found on Swamp Rock Hill. Sofia tells her family that her Buttercup Troop is going there next week and invites Amber to come along because of her love for astronomy. At first, Amber doesn't want to because of her distaste for the outdoors but her parents agree with Sofia and she relents. On the day of the hike, Amber, against her mother's advice, arrives wearing a fancy outfit with the maids bringing a suitcase. Helen tells Amber that servants can't come and hands her a backpack full of camping gear. After taking something out and putting some gowns, jewelry, and perfume in, Amber learns they are walking the whole way to Swamp Rock Hill, to her horror. On the hike, Amber discovers that being out in the wilderness is tougher than she thought. Meanwhile, Ruby and Jade become obsessed with finding Mossy the Swamp Monster so they can become famous. Amber is horrified to hear about the swamp monster until Sofia tells her that Mossy is just a legend and no one has ever proven that the swamp monster is real. Suddenly, Amber steps on a rock and breaks one of her pump shoes. Helen hands her some boots to replace the broken pair. Amber doesn't want to wear them until Sofia tells her they're better for her feet and helps her put them on. Sofia also hands her a trouble whistle and tells her to use it for emergencies. Amber suddenly blows the whistle but her \"emergency\" is just that she's wearing boots prompting Sofia to tell her that's not an emergency while the other Buttercups find it hilarious that their friend has such a silly papa's girl for a sister. When Sofia tells her they are camping out in tents for the night, Amber begins to fret about the feather bed, silk comforters, and harpist to sing her a lullaby that she needs to sleep, to the amusement of the other Buttercups who can't believe that Amber is such a big baby. After seeing the Buttercups put up their tents, Amber realizes that the something she took out of her backpack and left behind was her tent and tells Sofia, who teaches her how to improvise. Taking Sofia's tip, Amber makes a tent out of her gowns and makes it smell nice with a sweet skunk that sprayed her earlier while the troop was eating Float Fruit. Thanks to the stars, Amber's finally starting to enjoy herself. The next day, Amber and the troop finally arrive at Swamp Rock Hill. While looking for the star stones she came for, Amber falls in the swamp and, after hearing the troop mistake her for Mossy, throws a temper tantrum and storms off with Sofia going after her. Suddenly, Mossy appears and Ruby and Jade give chase in a way that gets the entire troop stuck in a bog prompting Helen to blow her whistle to alert Sofia. After hearing the whistle and realizing the troop is in trouble, Sofia tells Amber she can go home if she wants to and goes off to help her friends. Sofia soon runs into Mossy and Amber appears behind her stating she'll help. The two girls soon realize that Mossy's harmless and gets her to help them rescue their friends. Mossy then leads them to where the star stones are and, after getting them, the troop head back with Amber now an official Buttercup wearing both the uniform and the tent making badge she earned the night before."

      "Make Way for Miss Nettle": " School's over, Sofia and James ask Amber if she would like to join them in the After School Gardening Club, but she refuses as she doesn't like digging in the dirt. Sofia and James head to the greenhouse and meet up with their friend, Prince Desmond. The three good fairies arrive to introduce Miss Nettle, a fairy who was their own apprentice, to be a teacher for Enchanted Gardening. The three good fairies leave and Miss Nettle teaches them about plants that grow big with magical plant food until they learn to grow plants on their own, demonstrating a Rising Rose and a quartet of Bouncing Bluebells. She then sets Desmond to grow a Singing Sunflower, Sofia a Dancing Daisy and James some Laughing Lillies. Sofia produces a small but still active daisy, Desmond grows a spectacular (both in height and singing ability) Singing Sunflower and James falls into temporary fits of hysterical laughter due to standing too close to his bunch of lilies. Miss Nettle heads to the school campus but Sofia notices Miss Nettle's glove fell and she attempts to return it, leaving James and Desmond to have fun. After Miss Nettle sneaks into the main office of Royal Prep, she tries to find the spell book which would make her the most powerful fairy in the world until Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather show up and spot Miss Nettle. As the fairies confront her for finding the spell book in their office, Miss Nettle traps them in a bubble with their wands confiscated so that they won't go after her. Suddenly, Sofia witnesses Miss Nettle and the fairies trapped, and the fairies seek help from Sofia and her friends to get the spell book before Miss Nettle gets it. Sofia warns James and Desmond about the fairies, and hurries to Professor Popov for help as no one else in the school is left. As they went from the ballroom to get him, Professor Popov spotted Miss Nettle messing up the library, but she traps him in a bubble, The three gang try to find more ways like finding a map of the whole school, and turns out the spell book is located in the clock tower as the fairies made Sofia some ideas while in the bubble. The gang approaches the clock tower and it's impossible to climb up, Sofia uses her rose pinned from her hair to let Desmond grow it to a stalk, making them climb up while Desmond is afraid to do it. As they reach the top, the clock moves and they notice the spell book as it's carried by one of the figures that resembles Flora. Miss Nettle shows up trapping them and does \"the best part\" and made a \"deal\" to get the spell book, The three agrees but it leaves them tricked when she says that she would only free the fairies after learning every spell from their book and become the most powerful fairy in the world, and rushes to the greenhouse. Sofia and the gang remembers what the laughing lillies did to James, and lets Desmond grow them but he's is still too scared to face her, until James advises him about being royal and brave. Somehow James makes an idea and the gang rushes to the greenhouse, sneaking from Miss Nettle to distract her from doing her spells. Sofia and Desmond continue sneaking to grow the laughing lillies, Miss Nettle spots them underneath the table, but the lillies grow and sprays pollen on her face which make her laugh uncontrollably until she drops the spell book, The gang rushes to the office where the fairies are trapped, and are saved by their cleverness to find the spell on the 24th page and a wand. With the fairies freed from the bubble, They ask where Miss Nettle has gone to and find she has disappeared and sneaked up behind them. The evil fairy makes her final move but Desmond jumps on her, leaving her wand and him in a bubble. Miss Nettle has finally lost, and the fairies free Desmond. Finally, the fairies banish Miss Nettle with her wand confiscated. The brave gang still forgets one thing, they'll have to free Professor Popov, ending the episode as they chase the poor trapped professor across the grounds."

      "Tri-Kingdom Picnic": " The Kingdoms of Enchancia, Khaldoun, and Wei-Ling have once again gotten together for the annual Tri-Kingdom Picnic and everyone tells Sofia how great it is. While playing catch with Jun and Maya, James comes over and drags Sofia away to show her something. Meanwhile, King Roland announces to the other rulers that for the first time, they will be playing Picnic Games, just like their children do. The thing James wanted to show Sofia is the Golden Chalice which is awarded to the Kingdom that wins the most Picnic Games. Unfortunately, he's never won it since he's always been partnered with Amber, who dislikes outdoor sports. Since Sofia likes Flying Derby, James asks her if she would like to be his teammate which she agrees to. Amber in the meantime plans to teach Princess Leena how to decorate a parasol. After changing into their team jerseys, Sofia and James join the other kids. The first game is the Flying Horseshoe Toss. Sofia makes the best toss, so Enchancia wins. While Sofia is congratulated for winning, James begins to brag and acts a little obnoxious, which upsets everyone else especially Sofia. Baileywick leads the group to the second game: The Golden Egg-On-A-Spoon race. Roland explains to the other adults that their games will be just for fun, with no prize. The first game they play is Musical Thrones. After everyone quickly sits down, Emperor Quon falls over and quickly excuses himself, embarrassed. Elsewhere, Amber tells Leena the first step of decorating a parasol is to glue on the jewels. Leena struggles to get the glue out of her bottle and accidentally gets it all over Amber. Maya wins the Golden Egg-On-A-Spoon race and while everyone else congratulates her, James throws a temper tantrum and goes on to make up a bunch of excuses about why he didn't win. He also demands a do-over of the race, but Baileywick says the Kaldune team won fair and square so there's no need for that. James leaves in a huff and angrily brushes Sofia off when she tries to follow him. After apologizing to her friends for James's behavior, Sofia leaves to go talk to him. Amber and Leena are now putting glitter on their parasols but Leena drops her glitter and once again gets it all over Amber. Empress Lin-Lin is trying to get her husband to participate in the Blazing Badminton game but Quon refuses. Roland gets an idea and begins playing the game poorly on purpose to show Quon that even if you're clumsy you can still have fun playing. Quon, who now feels somewhat better, decides to give it a try. Sofia finds James and asks him to be nicer to the others, but James doesn't think he's doing anything wrong. The Tri-Kingdom Volleyball game begins and Sofia and James lose a point because they bumped into each other and missed the ball. James gets mad again and tells Sofia to stop fooling around because he wants to win. The Enchancia team does end up winning this game but Sofia and her friends aren't having fun anymore and, while everyone heads over to the Enchanted Discus game, James rudely rubs his team's victory in everyone else's faces, even when Sofia pleads for him to stop. Having had enough of his attitude and behavior, the kids decide they don't want to play any more games and storm off. Sofia is equally fed up and leaves too. Sofia goes over to where Amber and Leena are finishing up their parasols and they show them off to her. When Amber asks what Sofia is doing wandering around since the games shouldn't be over yet, she tells her nobody wants to play anymore because James was being a bad sport. Amber suggests that maybe she needs to show James the right way to act but Sofia isn't sure how to do this, until she sees the their parents playing Bewitching Bowling which gives her an idea. She brings James over to watch the game and points out that even though their father isn't winning he's still having fun which is what really matters. James finally comes to understand that he ruined the games for everyone and goes with Sofia to apologize. James apologizes to everyone for being a bad sport though the other kids seem hesitant to accept it. While he momentarily leaves to go get something, Khalid explains to Sofia that an apology won't change what's already happened. James returns with the enchanted discus and promises to be a good sport if they want to play, and in the end everyone agrees to. Jun and Jin win the discus game and this time James congratulates them. Maya and Khalid win Capture The Crown and he is a good sport about that as well. Since that was the final game, it's now time to announce the winner of the Golden Chalice. The kingdom of Kaldune is declared the winner and while everyone else is celebrating, James takes the chalice and although he hesitates at first, he presents it to Maya and Khalid, saying they deserve it. Sofia praises his kindness and tells him there's always next year for the two of them to try and win."

      "One for the Books": " Sofia and the other princes and princesses arrive at Royal Prep after the summer holidays. Vivian tells Sofia about all the activities she has done, including ballet or a music festival for example. The students are greeted by Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, who welcome them back for a new school year. After their speech the newest students are supposed to follow Fauna to the Noble Novice classroom, the students moving up to Regal Rotunda follow Merryweather, while the students starting Majestic Hall, including Sofia, Amber, James, Vivian, and Desmond, are lead by Flora. Amber is excited to finally attend Majestic Hall, James mentions the homework they will get, about which Desmond is happy about and offers to help James with it once more. Eventually, Flora and the following students come to the classroom where they are greeted by their new teacher Professor Pecullian, a magical faun, who insists on them calling him Mr. P. Having introduced the children to their new tutor, the fairy leaves while the students sits down at their desks, Desmond is already putting his books eagerly on his table. Mr. P starts the lesson and uses his magic to turn the desks with his pupils upside down, explaining he wants them to see things differently. While Sofia calls it a fun experience and even notices the floor pattern, Desmond is scared. Consequently, the new teacher goes on, moving the tables through the room, further explaining his methods. After he finished, Desmond's book falls of his table and the teacher picks it up. Surprisingly for Desmond, he announces that they won't use books today as he wants them to learn by doing things, not by reading books because they only teach facts but no feelings. Since he explained his motivation, he goes on starting the first project, which is Mystery Gardening, not Enchanted Gardening to Desmond's surprise. Each of the students receive a little tree which will grow fruit if they find out what each of the trees like. If every tree grows fruit in time, they will make \"Magical Mystery Jam\" out of them. To complete the task the pupils are task with going outside to explore it. Desmond is nervous as he doesn't now how to learn without his books. Mr. P. encourages him to join the others after asking if he needs any help and being denied and the student proceeds to sit under a tree, not knowing what to do. James on the other hand succeeds in getting his tree to grow fruit by feeding it pudding, making his owner proud as he is the first in class to get fruit. Vivian's tree reacts to her humming, Amber's magical tree likes compliments. Sofia solves her mystery as she notices her tree growing when in proximity to the other trees. She rightfully deduces that her tree likes friends. Meanwhile Desmond still hasn't figured out what makes his tree grow fruit, even trying the things that made the other trees grow out of frustration. Sofia tries to help him but naturally as he is the brightest student, he denies needing help and goes to search for a solution to his problem in the library with a book. He searches for a book on Mystery Gardening but even the only book he finds states it is a mystery. Sofia joins him and tries to help him again, finally Desmond gives in and tells her how frustrated he is because he used to be the best and is now the worst, unable to finish the project. Sofia tries to encourage him but fails, making him refuse again. To make things worse Mr. P finds them, asking if Desmond's tree had grown any fruit. Desmond's nervousness and embarrassment causes him to lie that it does and agrees he will be back in the classroom in five minutes. Mr. P believes it and leaves, Desmond gets frustrated as he realizes his mistake but he still does not accept help from Sofia or James who seems to understand the project best. He pushes the concerned girl out of the library as his eye falls on a book on Enchanted Gardening. Not wanting to fail in front of the class he takes it together with his still no single fruit growing tree to the greenhouse, exactly following the instructions in the book trying to get the magical plant to grow fruit. To his disappointment, it not only doesn't work it even makes things worse as the little plant grows into a havoc making tree monster that starts breaking apart the greenhouse. Desmond runs out of the building, now standing there without a tree or a fruit. Desmond tries to lock the monster in but it escapes through a window. When Desmond comes to her, Sofia agrees to help him out. They go to the greenhouse together to look for the monster and try to catch it. Naturally, Sofia is shocked when she sees the mess the little tree made. As she finds the book Desmond used the looks at the last page of the chapter Desmond read where it says not to use the instructions to make a mystery plant grow as it will turn into a monster. To reverse this their task is to sprinkle it with blue anti-food and replant it. Back outside Sofia finds clues where it went and they follow it to the library finding it reading books. They try to catch the tricky thing and after some failed attempts, they eventually succeed in potting it into its pot and turning it back into a tree. Sadly the finally turned to normal tree does not grow fruit instead getting depressed looking even worse than before, leading Desmond to further frustration as he thinks not to be the brightest in class anymore. Finally Sofia is able to comfort him and encourage him to ask Mr. P for help. Back in the classroom James is very confident, even asking if anyone needs help, as he did get the tree to grow fruit first. Sofia and Desmond arrive, the latter finally asking the teacher for help, which earns him shocked reactions from his fellow students. Still he finally gives in and asks what to do. Mr. P asks him if he could open a glass of jam for him, showing his student that even teachers sometimes need help. He lifts Desmond up in the air, tells him to look at things from a new way and gives him clues how to solve his problem. As his teacher tells him that Vivian's tree likes music, James's tree likes pudding and Amber's plant likes compliments he slowly begins to realize what all the magical plants have in common: They all like what their respective owners like. After solving the mystery he tries reading \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" to his little, magical tree, after realizing the reason why the tree monster was in the library was that it liked books because he does too. The tree finally grows fruit and Mr. P states that Desmond was the only one to solve the mystery connecting all the trees, making him happy and confident again. James gets a bit sad but quickly recovers as Mr. P tells him he still did well. At last they get on making \"Magical Mystery Jam\" after the classroom is turn into a \"Jamnasium\" by Mr. P."

      "The Little Witch": " Jade, Ruby and Sofia are making preparations for Jade's birthday party when a witch, who is hiding in the bushes, begins hexing them. Sofia learns from Jade that the witch is named Lucinda and Lucinda goes on to hex Jade's garden, flowers and the decorations before leaving. Jade tells Sofia that Lucinda came to the village a few months after Sofia went to live in the castle, and Ruby adds that she's always playing tricks on everyone. Because there are now bees flying around since the lanterns were turned into beehives, Sofia suggests the party be held indoors, and with that settled the three girls go out into town to hand out the party invitations.Unfortunately, they run into Lucinda again and she starts hexing everyone. Sofia decides to go talk to her, despite her friends' fear that she will be hexed. Sofia stumbles upon Lucinda sitting alone on a staircase, looking sadly at one of the invitations and saying that she never gets invited to parties. When Sofia approaches her, she goes back to being snarky and when Sofia tells her it's not nice to hex people, says that's the whole point. She also reveals that she doesn't have any friends and claims to not want any but Sofia correctly guesses that, since she wants to be invited to Jade's party, she does want friends. Lucinda threatens to hex Sofia if she doesn't leave her alone but Sofia stands her ground and shows no fear even after she carries out her threat. Seeing she can't fool the princess, Lucinda admits that Sofia is right and tells her she just can't help being mean, since she comes from a long line of witches and all they do is hex others, so they have trouble getting along with regular people. Sofia tells her about becoming a Princess overnight and how it took practice and a little help learning how to be a princess. She offers to help Lucinda make friends and says that the first step is to apologize to everyone, but Lucinda struggles to just say \"I'm sorry.\" Ruby and Jade are still handing out invitations when Sofia and Lucinda come over. The two of them panic when they see Lucinda, but Sofia says it's okay. Lucinda manages to apologize to Jade but Jade does not accept it. Sofia thinks Lucinda is being sincere and, as such, she should be invited to the party. But Jade absolutely refuses to do this, believing that she is planning to play an even meaner trick later on, and angrily tells Lucinda she will never invite her. An angry Lucinda hexes Jade by making a rain cloud appear over her, but after Sofia scolds her, she makes the cloud go away and even creates a wind to dry Jade off. However, Jade still won't invite her to the party and privately tells Ruby that she will build a witch trap to keep Lucinda from ruining her party anymore than she already has.Lucinda is feeling hopeless about ever making friends, but Sofia says it's not hopeless; it just might take more than one apology. Since it was so hard just to say sorry, Lucinda decides to go back to being mean since it's easier for her and takes off on her broom, with Sofia hanging off the end. Sofia falls off and Lucinda magically creates a pillow for her to land on. She brushes off Sofia's praise for her kindness by saying it was her fault she got in trouble in the first place. Sofia suggests that if Lucinda went around fixing all the trouble she caused for everyone else, she could prove that she has changed and make friends. All the kids run away when they see Lucinda, but Sofia tells them she came to undo all the hexes. Lucinda goes around assuring everyone of this, but nobody really believes her, until she fixes everything just like she said she would, and is forgiven. Ruby tells Lucinda that if it was up to her, she'd invite her to the party, but that is up to Jade. Since the party isn't until later, Sofia tells Lucinda she has plenty of time to fix Jade's garden so the party can be held outdoors again, and Jade would be so happy she would invite her for sure. Lucinda thanks Sofia for helping her and convinces her to ride to Jade's house on her broom, after Sofia was unsure of doing so at first due to her bad experience with it the first time.They arrive at Jade's house and Lucinda unhexes the garden and lanterns. Inside the house, Ruby and Jade are decorating when Jade hears laughter from outside. The two of them see Lucinda and Jade immediately assumes that she has come to cause trouble, but Ruby disagrees. Jade prepares her witch trap and they hide, but since Sofia was the first one to walk in, she is caught in the trap and all the decorations and the cake are ruined when the trap hits the ceiling. Jade blames it all on Lucinda and yells at her to go away, causing Lucinda to run off in tears. Sofia tells Jade that if she hadn't set that trap nothing would have been ruined, and that Lucinda had come to fix her garden, not cause more trouble like she thought, because she wanted to be invited to the party. Jade feels guilty and leaves to go find Lucinda. Lucinda is out in town angrily hexing things, with Jade, Sofia and Ruby running after her. After catching up to Lucinda, Jade apologizes for not giving her a second chance and gives her an invitation to the party. Now that amends have been made, the four of them return to her house, where Lucinda decorates the garden with the magically-improved decorations, and makes a more impressive cake as well, just as everyone arrives for the party. Lucinda performs nice tricks for all the guests, and then joins Jade on a bench, where they exchange jewelry as a sign of their new friendship. Finally, after Sofia and Ruby join them, Lucinda creates magical fireworks to top things off."
